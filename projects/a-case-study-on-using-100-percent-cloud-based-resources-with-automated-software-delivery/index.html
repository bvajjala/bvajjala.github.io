  </header>
  
  <p>
[We, KaDeeCorp Continuous Delivery in the Cloud](http://bvajjala.github.io/Consulting) help – typically large – organizations create one-click software
delivery systems so that they can deliver software in a more rapid,
reliable and repeatable manner (AKA [Continuous
Delivery](http://www.amazon.com/Continuous-Delivery-Deployment-Automation-Addison-Wesley/dp/0321601912 &#8220;Continuous Delivery book&#8221;)).
The only way this works is when Development works with Operations. As
has been written elsewhere in this series, this means changing the
hearts and minds of people because most organizations are used to
working in ‘siloed’ environments. In this entry, I focus on
implementation, by describing a real-world case study in which we have
brought Continuous Delivery Operations to the Cloud consisting of a team
of Systems and Software Engineers.  </p>




<p> For years, we’ve helped customers in [Continuous
Integration](&#8220;) and Testing so more of our work was with Developers and Testers. Several years ago, we hired a Sys Admin/Engineer/DBA who was passionate about
automation. As a result of this, we began assembling multiple two-person
“[DevOps](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps &#8220;DevOps on Wikipedia&#8221;)”
teams consisting of a Software Engineer and a Systems Engineer both of
whom being big-picture thinkers and not just “Developers” or “Sys
Admins”. These days, we put together these targeted teams of Continuous
Delivery and Cloud experts with hands-on experience as Software
Engineers and Systems Engineers so that organizations can deliver
software as quickly and as often as the business requires. </p>


<p>A couple of years ago we already had a few people in the company who
were experimenting with using Cloud infrastructures so we thought this
would be a great opportunity in providing cloud-based delivery
solutions. In this case study, I cover a project we are currently
working on for a large organization. It is a new Java-based web services
project so we’ve been able to implement solutions using our recommended
software delivery patterns rather than being constrained by legacy tools
or decisions. However, as I note, we aren’t without constraints on this
project. If I were you, I’d call “BS!” on any “case study” in which
everything went flawlessly and assume it was an extremely small or a
theoretical project in the author’s mind. This is the real deal. Enough
said, on to the case study.      </p>

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/stelligent_img/aws_tools.jpg" alt="AWS Tools" /></p>

<p><strong>Fast Facts</strong></p>

<p><strong>Industry</strong>: Healthcare, Public Sector</p>

<p><strong>Profile</strong>: The customer is making available to all, free of charge, a
series of software specifications and open source software modules that
together make up an oncology-extended Electronic Health Record
capability.
<strong>Key Business Issues</strong>: The customer was seeking that all team members
are provided “unencumbered” access to infrastructure resources without
the usual “request and wait” queued-based procedures present in most
organizations
<strong>Stakeholders</strong>: Over 100 people consisting of Developers, Testers,
Analysts, Architects, and Project Management.
<strong>Solution:</strong> Continuous Delivery Operations in the Cloud
<strong>Key Tools/Technologies</strong>: Amazon Web Services  - AWS (Elastic Computer
Cloud (EC2), (Simple Storage Service (S3), Elastic Block Storage (EBS),
etc.), Jenkins, JIRA Studio, Ant, Ivy, Tomcat and PostgreSQL</p>

<p><strong>The Business Problem</strong>
The customer was used to dealing with long drawn-out processes with
Operations teams that lacked agility. They were accustomed to submitting
Word documents via email to an Operations teams, attending multiple
meetings and getting their environments setup weeks or months later. We
were compelled to develop a solution that reduced or eliminated these
problems that are all too common in many large organizations (Note: each
problem is identified as a letter and number, for example: P1, and
referred to later):</p>

<ol>
<li>Unable to deliver software to users on demand (P1)</li>
<li>Queued requests for provisioned instances (P2)</li>
<li>Unable to reprovision precise target environment configuration on
demand (P3)</li>
<li>Unable to provision instances on demand (P4)</li>
<li>Configuration errors in target environments presenting deployment
bottlenecks while Operations and Development teams troubleshoot
errors (P5)</li>
<li>Underutilized instances (P6)</li>
<li>No visibility into purpose of instance (P7)</li>
<li>No visibility into the costs of instance (P8)</li>
<li>Users cannot terminate instances (P9)</li>
<li>Increased Systems Operations personnel costs (P10)</li>
</ol>


<p><strong>Our Team</strong>
We put together a four-person team to create a solution for delivering
software and managing the internal Systems Operations for this 100+
person project. We also hired a part-time Security expert. The team
consists of two Systems Engineers and two Software Engineers focused on
Continuous Delivery and the Cloud. One of the Software Engineers is the
Solutions Architect/PM for our team.</p>

<p><strong>Our Solution</strong>
We began with the end in mind based on the customer’s desire for
unencumbered access to resources. To us, “unencumbered” did not mean
without controls; it meant providing automated services over queued
“request and wait for the Ops guy to fulfill the request” processes. Our
approach is that every resource is in the cloud: Software as a Service
(SaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS) or Infrastructure as a Service
(IaaS) to reduce operations costs (P10) and increase efficiency. In
doing this, effectively all project resources are available on demand in
the cloud. We have also automated the software delivery process to
Development and Test environments and working on the process of
one-click delivery to production. I’ve identified the problem we’re
solving – from above – in parentheses (P1, P8, etc.). The solution
includes:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>On-Demand Provisioning</strong> – All hardware is provided via EC2’s
virtual instances in the cloud, on demand (P2). We’ve developed a
“Provisioner” (PaaS) that provides any authorized team member the
capability to click a button and get their project-specific target
environment (P3) in the AWS’ cloud – thus, providing unencumbered
access to hardware resources. (P4) The Provisioner provides all
authorized team members the capability to monitor instance usage
(P6) and adjust accordingly. Users can terminate their own virtual
instances (P9).</li>
<li><strong>Continuous Delivery</strong> Solution so that the team can deliver
software to users on demand (P1):

<ul>
<li>Automated build script using Ant – used to drive most of the
other automation tools</li>
<li>Dependency Management using Ivy. We will be adding Sonatype
Nexus</li>
<li>Database Integration/Change using Ant and Liquibase</li>
<li>Automated Static Analysis using Sonar (with CheckStyle,
FindBugs, JDepend, and Cobertura)</li>
<li>Test framework hooks for running JUnit, etc.</li>
<li>Reusing remote Deployment custom Ant scripts that use Java
Secure Channel and Web container configuration. However, we will
be starting a process of using a more robust tool such as
ControlTier to perform deployment</li>
<li>Automated document generation using Grand, SchemaSpy (ERDs) and
UMLGraph</li>
<li>Continuous Integration server using Hudson</li>
<li>Continuous Delivery pipeline system – we are customizing Hudson
to emulate a Deployment Pipeline</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Issue Tracking</strong> – We’re using the JIRA Studio SaaS product from
Atlassian (P10), which provides issue tracking, version-control
repository, online code review and a Wiki. We also manage the
relationship with the vendor and perform the user administration
including workflow management and reporting.</li>
<li><strong>Development Infrastructure</strong>&ndash; There were numerous tools selected
by the customer for Requirements Management and Test Management and
Execution including HP QC, LoadRunner, SoapUI, Jama Contour. Many of
these tools were installed and managed by our team onto the EC2
instances</li>
<li><strong>Instance Management</strong>&ndash; Any authorized team member is able to
monitor virtual instance usage by viewing a web-based dashboard (P6,
P7, P8) we developed. This helps to determine instances that should
no longer be in use or may be eating up too much money. There is a
policy that test instances (e.g. Sprint Testing) are terminated no
less than every two weeks. This promotes ephemeral environments and
test automation.</li>
<li><strong>Deployment to Production</strong> – Much of the pre-production
infrastructure is in place, but we will be adding some additional
automation features to make it available to users in production
(P1). The deployment sites are unique in that we aren’t hosting a
single instance used by all users and it’s likely the software will
be installed at each site. One plan is to deploy separate instances
to the cloud or to virtual instances that are shipped to the user
centers</li>
<li><strong>System Monitoring and Disaster Recovery</strong> – Using
<a href="https://www.cloudkick.com/" title="CloudKick AWS Monitoring">CloudKick</a>
to notify us of instance errors or anomalies. EC2 provides us with
some monitoring as well. We will be implementing a more robust
monitoring solution using Nagios or something similar in the coming
months. Through automation and supporting process, we’ve implemented
a disaster recovery solution.</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>Benefits</strong>
The benefits are primarily around removing the common bottlenecks from
processes so that software can be delivered to users and team members
more often. Also, we think our approach to providing on-demand services
over queued-based requests increases agility and significantly reduces
costs. Here are some of the benefits:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Deliver software more often</strong> – to users and internally (testers,
managers, demos)</li>
<li><strong>Deliver software more quickly</strong> – since the software delivery
process is automated, we identify the SVN tag and click a button to
deliver the software to any environment</li>
<li><strong>Software delivery is rapid, reliable and repeatable</strong>. All
resources can be reproduced with a single click – source code,
configuration, environment configuration, database and network
configuration is all checked in and versioned and part of a single
delivery system.</li>
<li><strong>Increased visibility</strong> to environments and other resources – All
preconfigured virtual hardware instances are available for any
project member to provision without needing to submit forms or
attend countless meetings</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>Tools</strong>
Here are some of the tools we are using to deliver this solution. Some
of the tools were chosen by our team exclusively and some by other
stakeholders on the project.</p>

<li><strong>Provisioner</strong> (Custom Web-based) – Target Environment Provisioning
and Virtual Instance Monitoring</li>
<li><a href="http://www.puppetlabs.com/" title="Puppet"><strong>Puppet</strong></a> – Systems
Configuration Management</li>
<li><strong>QTP</strong> – Test Automation</li>
<li><strong>SoapUI</strong> – Web Services Test Automation</li>
<li><a href="http://www.sonarsource.org/" title="Sonar"><strong>Sonar</strong></a> – code quality
analysis (Includes CheckStyle, PMD, Cobertura, etc.)</li>
<li><strong>Tomcat/JBoss</strong> – Web container used by Development. We’ve written
script to automate the deployment and container configuration</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>Solutions we’re in the process of Implementing</strong>
We’re less than a year into the project and have much more work to do.
Here are a few projects we’re in the process or will be starting to
implement soon:</p>

<ul>
<li>System Configuration Management – We’ve started using Puppet, but we
are expanding how it’s being used in the future</li>
<li>Deployment Automation – The move to a more robust Deployment
automation tool such as ControlTier</li>
<li>Development Infrastructure Automation – Automating the provisioning
and configuration of tools such as HP QC in a cloud environment.
etc.</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>What we would do Differently</strong>
Typically, if we were start a Java-based project and recommend tools
around testing, we might choose the following tools for testing,
requirements and test management based on the particular need:</p>

<ul>
<li>Selenium with <a href="http://saucelabs.com/" title="SauceLabs Selenium">SauceLabs</a></li>
<li>JIRA Studio for Test Management</li>
<li>JIRA Studio for Requirements Management</li>
<li>JMeter – or other open source tool – for Load Testing</li>
</ul>


<p>However, like most projects there are many stakeholders who have their
preferred approach and tools they are familiar in using, the same way
our team does. Overall, we are pleased with how things are going so far
and the customer is happy with the infrastructure and approach that is
in place at this time. I could probably do another case study on dealing
with multiple SaaS vendors, but I will leave that for another post.</p>

<p><strong>Summary</strong>
There’s much more I could have written about what we’re doing, but I
hope this gives you a decent perspective of how we’ve implemented a
DevOps philosophy with Continuous Delivery and the Cloud and how this
has led our customer to more a service-based, unencumbered and agile
environment. </p>
