Initially I named this page *Quotes* but then it overgrew to a collection of wise aphorisms, practical advises and maxima. I renamed it to *Values*.


> The thing that doesn’t fit is the thing that is most interesting. — **Richard Feynman**

> What I cannot create, I do not understand. — **Richard Feynman**

This is the phrase left on Richard Feynman's blackboard at the time of his death.

> De omnibus dubitandum. — **René Descartes**

"Doubt everything", René Descartes' personal motto.

> Bene vixit qui bene latuit. — **Ovid**

"He lives well, who conceals himself well", another motto of René Descartes.

> It is not possible to convert one form of energy to another with 100% efficiency. — **The Second Law of Thermodynamics**

I think it applies not only to thermodynamics but to practically everything.

> Numquam ponenda est pluralitas sine necessitate. — **William of Ockham**

"Entities must not be multiplied beyond necessity", Occam's Razor. Binding it together with the 2nd Law of Thermodynamics I would say: Fight the entropy every day of your life.

> I would much rather have men ask why I have no statue, than why I have one. — **Marcus Porcius Cato**
