# About Me
-
Hi, my name is Balaji Vajjala.

I’m a generalist and a software developer, so people sometimes call me a “coding architect” which I’m perfectly happy with.

I’m fascinated by the new trends in software delivery which is all about speed (delivering the changes faster to your users) and reliability (not letting the changes disrupt the existing business). These trends are generally referred to by the term DevOps.

If I would have more time I would spend it on some of the other state-of-the-art stuff like cloud hosting, mobile app development, NoSql databases, infrastructure as code, …
