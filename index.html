  <div class="entry-content"><h1>What is Continuous Integration</h1>

<p><em>Martin Fowler has the best description of CI</em></p>

<p>  Continuous Integration is a software development practice where members of a team integrate their work frequently, usually each person integrates at least daily &ndash; leading to multiple integrations per day. Each integration is verified by an automated build (including test) to detect integration errors as quickly as possible. Many teams find that this approach leads to significantly reduced integration problems and allows a team to develop cohesive software more rapidly.</p>

<h3>ï¿¼ï¿¼What Iâve been up to&hellip;</h3>

<ul>
<li>Last 6 months converting our order systems to high-availability and continuous deployment.</li>
<li>Why 6 months?

<ul>
<li>Because the concept is straightforward, but itâs implications affect a lot of your organisation.</li>

<li>Continuous Deployment</li>
<li>Continuous Delivery</li>
<li>Continuous Integration</li>
</ul>


</div>

<aside class='notes'>

<p>I don&rsquo;t have to tell you guys about DevOps, but for our purposes the main point is that we can do more stuff using the DevOps principles and Deliver software in a Agile Fashion.</p>

<h3>ï¿¼ï¿¼âDeploymentâ? âDeliveryâ?</h3>

<ul>
<li>Continuous integration is continuous, automated build and test.!</li>
<li>Continuous delivery is the next obvious step; be continuously release-ready !</li>
<li>Continuous deployment is the final step, the continuous delivery of software to production.</li>
</ul>

<h3>ï¿¼ï¿¼âDeploymentâ? âDeliveryâ?</h3>

<ul>
<li>Constant QA is the common theme.!</li>
<li>In practice thereâs a continuous spectrum of options, each organisation has different needs and constraints.!</li>
<li>But if you trust your testing and process you can adopt the level appropriate for you.</li>
</ul>


</div>

<h3>ï¿¼ï¿¼Why Continuous deployment?</h3>

<ul>
<li>We want to release features, not âwhat ever happens to be doneâ!</li>
<li>Automation: Releasing is hard, automation makes it repeatable!</li>
<li>Remove organisational bottlenecks to releases</li>
</ul>


</div>

<h3>ï¿¼ï¿¼Why Continuous deployment? Stakeholder benefits</h3>

<ul>
<li>To customers: Youâll get your requested feature faster!!</li>
<li>To management: Youâll get results faster and clearer progress.!</li>
<li>To devs: No more death-marches, mad- dashes, clean-up after releases.!</li>
<li>To admins: You know which change broke the system!</li>
</ul>

<h3>ï¿¼ï¿¼Continuous deployment: So how do you actually do it?</h3>

<ul>
<li>Continuous deployment guides tend to focus on the high-level philosophy!</li>
<li>But how do you actually get a feature from a customer request to your servers?</li>
</ul>


</div>

</section>

<section class='slide'><div class='content'>

<h3>ï¿¼ï¿¼Development workflow</h3>

<ul>
<li>Continuous deployment implies a clearer development process.!</li>
<li>You need to know what is going out when you release, not a dump of the current state.!</li>
<li>Hence release by feature</li>
</ul>


</div>

</section>

<section class='slide'><div class='content'>

<p>ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼</p>

<h3>ï¿¼ï¿¼Development</h3>

<ul>
<li>Track your feature requests in a bug tracker!</li>
<li>Branch on each feature, automatically test!</li>
<li>Pull requests for code-review/merge!</li>
<li>Automatic release to staging on each merge!</li>
<li>Promote from staging to production</li>
</ul>


</div>

<h3>ï¿¼ï¿¼Step 1: Track your requests</h3>

<ul>
<li>Each feature/update request should have a unique ID.!</li>
<li>This allows tracking the state of a feature from request to deployment.!</li>
<li>Bug-trackers are a good choice for this.
ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼</li>

<h3>Step 2: Work on this feature in a branch</h3>

<ul>
<li>Create a branch for just this feature!</li>
<li>Name it after the feature request!</li>
<li>Jira/Stash integration will do this!</li>
<li>The branch will be merged when complete!</li>
<li>You need a sane version control system!</li>
<li>We use git, Mercurial is good too
ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼</li>

<h3>ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼Step 3: Automatically test the branch</h3>

<ul>
<li>Run a continuous integration tool that will automatically run tests against the branch.!</li>
<li>Features may not be merged until all tests are passing.!</li>
<li>Stash has some features to support this.
ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼</li>

<h3>ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼Step 4: Code review</h3>

<ul>
<li>No code may be merged to the release branch until reviewed by other members of the team.!</li>
<li>Team members have a responsibility to ensure quality.
ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼</li>

<h3>ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼Step 5: Merge and release</h3>

<ul>
<li>Once all reviews and tests are passed them merge to release branch!</li>
<li>At this point we have a separate Bamboo plan that performs a full release.

<h3>ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼Step 6: Deploy to staging</h3>

<li>So if youâre doing all these releases, what about uptime?!</li>
<li>For public-facing service clustering/HA is important.!</li>
<li>Ideally you should be able to automate cluster configuration as part of the deployment

  <div class="entry-content"><h1>What is jenkins job builder</h1>

<p>Jenkins job builder is extreme good tool to manage your jenkins CI jobs, it takes simple description from YAML files, and use them to configure jenkins.</p>

<pre><code>#set free style job
#job-template.yml
- job:
    name: testjob
    project-type: freestyle
    defaults: global
    disabled: false
    display-name: 'Fancy job name'
    concurrent: true
    quiet-period: 5
    workspace: /srv/build-area/job-name
    block-downstream: false
    block-upstream: false
</code></pre>

<p>Then put your jenkins access into jenkins.ini file</p>

<pre><code>[jenkins]
user=USERNAME
password=USER_TOKEN
url=JENKINS_URL
ignore_cache=IGNORE_CACHE_FLAG
</code></pre>

<p>Based on the job configuration above, you just need to type command</p>

<pre><code>$ jenkins-jobs --conf jenkins.ini update job-template.yaml 
</code></pre>

<p>Then your job <em>testjob</em> is created in your jenkins server.</p>

<p>The project is created by <a href="https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/InfraTeam">openstack-infrastructure team</a>, it is used to manage the openstack environment, fairly good.</p>

<h1>How it works</h1>

<p>There is no magic behind it, <em>jenkins-jobs</em> just convert the <em>job-template.yaml</em> to jenkins XML request file, and use jenkins remote API to send create request.</p>

<p>Try to do below to understand this.</p>

<pre><code>$ jenkins-jobs test job-template.yaml -o .
</code></pre>

<p>Then xml file <em>testjob</em> is created, see</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?xml version="1.0" ?&gt;
&lt;project&gt;
  &lt;actions/&gt;
  &lt;description&gt;

&amp;lt;!-- Managed by Jenkins Job Builder --&amp;gt;&lt;/description&gt;
  &lt;keepDependencies&gt;false&lt;/keepDependencies&gt;
  &lt;disabled&gt;false&lt;/disabled&gt;
  &lt;displayName&gt;Fancy job name&lt;/displayName&gt;
  &lt;blockBuildWhenDownstreamBuilding&gt;false&lt;/blockBuildWhenDownstreamBuilding&gt;
  &lt;blockBuildWhenUpstreamBuilding&gt;false&lt;/blockBuildWhenUpstreamBuilding&gt;
  &lt;concurrentBuild&gt;true&lt;/concurrentBuild&gt;
  &lt;customWorkspace&gt;/srv/build-area/job-name&lt;/customWorkspace&gt;
  &lt;quietPeriod&gt;5&lt;/quietPeriod&gt;

<p>Now you can use curl command to send the request (testjob) directly !!</p>

<pre><code>$ curl --user USER:PASS -H "Content-Type: text/xml" -s --data "@testjob" "http://jenkins-server/createItem?name=testjob"
</code></pre>

<h2>How to recreate your jenkins job</h2>

<p>Looks great, finally you need think about how to re-create your jenkins job, it is also simple, just download the config.xml</p>

<pre><code>$ curl --user USER:PASS http://jenkins-server/testjob/config.xml
</code></pre>

<p>Or open the configuration page in broswer *<a href="http://jenkins-server/testjob/configure*">http://jenkins-server/testjob/configure*</a> and map from YAML file.</p>

<p>You need to read <a href="http://ci.openstack.org/jenkins-job-builder/configuration.html">jenkins job builder&rsquo;s guideline</a> to know the map, generate it had level Macro like <a href="https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/InfraTeam">builders</a>, which is connected to the <a href="https://github.com/openstack-infra/jenkins-job-builder/blob/master/jenkins_jobs/modules/builders.py">real python builders module</a> to do transformation from YAML to XML.</p>

<p>What you stated in YAML file like</p>

<pre><code>-job:
  name: test_job
  builders:
- shell: "make test"
</code></pre>

<p>it will be converted to</p>

<pre><code>&lt;builders&gt;
&lt;hudson.tasks.Shell&gt;
  &lt;command&gt;make test&lt;/command&gt;&lt;/hudson.tasks.Shell&gt;
&lt;/builders&gt;
</code></pre>

<h2>How to extend</h2>

<p>Greatly to see jenkins job builder already had lots of default modules to support your normal jenkins jobs, but there is exceptions like some none popular jenkins plugins or your own plugins.</p>

<p>Then it is time to extend the module, the existing document: Extending is not clear enough, I will use example to show how it works, code is in <a href="https://github.com/bv2012/jenkins-buddy">github jenkins-buddy</a> project</p>

<p><a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/ArtifactDeployer+Plugin">ArtifactDeployer</a> Plugin is used as example, this plugin is the popular plugin to deploy the artifacts to other folder.</p>

<p>Artifact Deploy Plugin</p>

<p><img src="../downloads/code/artifactdeploy.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>And I want to have .YAML like below</p>

<pre><code>*#artifactdeploy.yaml*
- job:
name: test-job
publishers:
  - artifactdeployer: 
  includes: 'buddy-*.tar.gz'
  remote: '/project/buddy'
</code></pre>

<h2>write codes to transform</h2>

<p>Now I need to download the existing jobs to see how XML looks like, using curl above, I got it like</p>

<pre><code>&lt;publishers&gt;
   ...  
  &lt;org.jenkinsci.plugins.artifactdeployer.ArtifactDeployerPublisher plugin="artifactdeployer@0.27"&gt;
&lt;entries&gt;
  &lt;org.jenkinsci.plugins.artifactdeployer.ArtifactDeployerEntry&gt;
&lt;includes&gt;buddy-*.tar.gz&lt;/includes&gt;
&lt;basedir&gt;&lt;/basedir&gt;
&lt;excludes&gt;&lt;/excludes&gt;
&lt;remote&gt;/project/buddy&lt;/remote&gt;
&lt;flatten&gt;false&lt;/flatten&gt;
&lt;deleteRemote&gt;false&lt;/deleteRemote&gt;
&lt;deleteRemoteArtifacts&gt;false&lt;/deleteRemoteArtifacts&gt;
&lt;deleteRemoteArtifactsByScript&gt;false&lt;/deleteRemoteArtifactsByScript&gt;
&lt;failNoFilesDeploy&gt;false&lt;/failNoFilesDeploy&gt;
  &lt;/org.jenkinsci.plugins.artifactdeployer.ArtifactDeployerEntry&gt;
&lt;/entries&gt;
&lt;deployEvenBuildFail&gt;false&lt;/deployEvenBuildFail&gt;
  &lt;/org.jenkinsci.plugins.artifactdeployer.ArtifactDeployerPublisher&gt;
..
&lt;/publishers&gt; 
</code></pre>

<p>It belongs the section publishers So I write the jenkins_buddy/modules/publishers.py module to add one function artifactdeployer:</p>

<pre><code>def artifactdeployer(parser, xml_parent, data):
    logger = logging.getLogger("%s:artifactdeployer" % __name__)
    artifactdeployer = XML.SubElement(xml_parent, 'org.jenkinsci.plugins.artifactdeployer.ArtifactDeployerPublisher')
    entries = XML.SubElement(artifactdeployer, 'entries')
    entry = XML.SubElement(entries, 'org.jenkinsci.plugins.artifactdeployer.ArtifactDeployerEntry')
    print data
    XML.SubElement(entry, 'includes').text = data['includes']
    XML.SubElement(entry, 'remote').text = data['remote']
</code></pre>

<p>It is the core part handling convert.</p>

<h3>Hook into jenkins-job builder</h3>

<p>Now you need hook this script into jenkins-jobs builder, thank for the entry_points in python, it can be used for this.</p>

<p>Create the plugin related script and structure, add new entry_point in setup.py</p>

<pre><code>#setup.py in jenkins-buddy
entry_points={
    'jenkins_jobs.publishers': [
    'artifactdeployer=jenkins_buddy.modules.publishers:artifactdeployer',
    ],
}
</code></pre>

<p>it tells jenkins-jobs if you meet new keyword artifactdeployer in publishers, please let me jenkins_buddy.modules.publishers:artifactdeployer to handle.</p>

<h3>Verify it</h3>

<p>Build the pip package local and install it</p>

<pre><code>$ python setup.py sdist
$ pip install dist/jenkins-buddy-0.0.5.zip
</code></pre>

<p>And verify the new job, Bingo, it works.</p>

<pre><code>$ jenkins-jobs test artifactdeploy.yaml -o . 
</code></pre>

<h3>###Make it more complete by checking jenkins plugin java code</h3>

<p>Maybe you noticed, it is hack solution, since I skipped some parameter converting and guess what the XML will look like, if you want to make it more complete, we need to check the java codes directly.</p>

<p>src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/artifactdeployer/ArtifactDeployerPublisher.java is the class we need to take care.</p>

<pre><code>@DataBoundConstructor
public ArtifactDeployerPublisher(List&lt;ArtifactDeployerEntry&gt; deployedArtifact, boolean deployEvenBuildFail) {
    this.entries = deployedArtifact;
    this.deployEvenBuildFail = deployEvenBuildFail;
    if (this.entries == null)
    this.entries = Collections.emptyList();
}
</code></pre>

<p>It is directly mapping from XML into internal data, if you need know more, learn how to develop jenkins plugin.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h1>## Workflow : Deploying/Release Apps from Development to Production  ##</h1>

<p>Deploying is a big part of the lives of most of our Engineering employees. We don&rsquo;t have a release manager and there are no set weekly deploys. Developers and designers are responsible for shipping new stuff themselves as soon as it&rsquo;s ready. This means that deploying needs to be as smooth and safe a process as possible.</p>

<p>The best system we&rsquo;ve found so far to provide this flexibility is to have people deploy branches. Changes never get merged to master until they have been verified to work in production from a branch. This means that master is always stable; a safe point that we can roll back to if there&rsquo;s a problem.</p>

<p>The basic workflow goes like this:</p>

<ul>
<li>Push changes to a branch in GitHub</li>
<li>Wait for the build to pass on our CI server (Jenkins)</li>
<li>Tell Hubot to deploy it</li>
<li>Verify that the changes work and fix any problems that come up</li>
<li>Merge the branch into master
Not too long ago, however, this system wasn&rsquo;t very smart. A branch could accidentally be deployed before the build finished, or even if the build failed. Employees could mistakenly deploy over each other. As the company has grown, we&rsquo;ve needed to add some checks and balances to help us prevent these kinds of mistakes.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Safety First</h2>

<p>The first thing we do now, when someone tries to deploy, is make a call to <a href="https://github.com/github/janky">Janky</a> to determine whether the current CI build is green. If it hasn&rsquo;t finished yet or has failed, we&rsquo;ll tell the deployer to fix the situation and try again.</p>

<p>Next we check whether the application is currently &ldquo;locked&rdquo;. The lock indicates that a particular branch is being deployed in production and that no other deploys of the application should proceed for the moment. Successful builds on the master branch would otherwise get deployed automatically, so we don&rsquo;t want those going out while a branch is being tested. We also don&rsquo;t want another developer to accidentally deploy something while the branch is out.</p>

<p>The last step is to make sure that the branch we&rsquo;re deploying contains the latest commit on master that has made it into production. Once a commit on master has been deployed to production, it should never be âremovedâ from production by deploying a branch that doesnât have that commit in it yet.</p>

<p>We use the GitHub API to verify this requirement. An endpoint on the github.com application exposes the SHA1 that is currently running in production. We submit this to the GitHub compare API to obtain the &ldquo;merge base&rdquo;, or the common ancestor, of master and the production SHA1. We can then compare this to the branch that we&rsquo;re attempting to deploy to check that the branch is caught up. By using the common ancestor of master and production, code that only exists on a branch can be removed from production, and changes that have landed on master but haven&rsquo;t been deployed yet won&rsquo;t require branches to merge them in before deploying.</p>

<p>If it turns out the branch is behind, master gets merged into it automatically. We do this using the new :sparkles:Merging API:sparkles: that we&rsquo;re making available today. This merge starts a new CI build like any other push-style event, which starts a deploy when it passes.</p>

<p>At this point the code actually gets deployed to our servers. We usually deploy to all servers for consistency, but a subset of servers can be specified if necessary. This subset can be by functional role â front-end, file server, worker, search, etc. â or we can specify an individual machine by name, e.g, &lsquo;fe7&rsquo;.</p>

<h2>Watch it in action</h2>

<p>What now? It depends on the situation, but as a rule of thumb, small to moderate changes should be observed running correctly in production for at least 15 minutes before they can be considered reasonably stable. During this time we monitor exceptions, performance, tweets, and do any extra verification that might be required. If non-critical tweaks need to be made, changes can be pushed to the branch and will be deployed automatically. In the event that something bad happens, rolling back to master only takes 30 seconds.</p>

<h2>All done!</h2>

<p>If everything goes well, it&rsquo;s time to merge the changes. At GitHub, we use Pull Requests for almost all of our development, so merging typically happens through the pull request page. We detect when the branch gets merged into master and unlock the application. The next deployer can now step up and ship something awesome.</p>

<h1>How do we do it?</h1>

<p>Most of the magic is handled by an internal deployment service called Heaven. At its core, Heaven is a catalog of Capistrano recipes wrapped up in a Sinatra application with a JSON API. Many of our applications are deployed using generic recipes, but more complicated apps can define their own to specify additional deployment steps. Wiring it up to Janky, along with clever use of post-receive hooks and the GitHub API, lets us hack on the niceties over time. Hubot is the central interface to both Janky and Heaven, giving everyone in Campfire great visibility into whatâs happening all of the time. As of this writing, 75 individual applications are deployed by Heaven.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h2><a href="/blog/2013/03/22/designing-a-restful-api-that-doesn-t-suck.html">Designing A RESTful API That Doesn&rsquo;t Suck</a></h2>

<p>As we&rsquo;re getting closer to shipping the first version of <a href="http://devo.ps">devo.ps</a> and we are joined by a few new team members, the team took the time to review the few principles we followed when designing our RESTful JSON API. A lot of these can be found on <a href="https://blog.apigee.com/taglist/rest_api_design">apigee&rsquo;s blog</a> (a recommended read). Let me give you the gist of it:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Design your API for developers first</strong>, they are the main users. In that respect, simplicity and intuitivity matter.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol#Request_methods">HTTP verbs</a></strong> instead of relying on parameters (e.g. <code>?action=create</code>). HTTP verbs map nicely with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete">CRUD</a>:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>POST</code> for <em>create</em>,</li>
<li><code>GET</code> for <em>read</em>,</li>
<li><code>DELETE</code> for <em>remove</em>,</li>
<li><code>PUT</code> for <em>update</em> (and <code>PATCH</code> too).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes">HTTP status codes</a></strong>, especially for errors (authentication required, error on the server side, incorrect parameters)â¦ There are plenty to choose from, here are a few:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>200</code>: <em>OK</em></li>
<li><code>201</code>: <em>Created</em></li>
<li><code>304</code>: <em>Not Modified</em></li>
<li><code>400</code>: <em>Bad Request</em></li>
<li><code>401</code>: <em>Unauthorized</em></li>
<li><code>403</code>: <em>Forbidden</em></li>
<li><code>404</code>: <em>Not Found</em></li>
<li><code>500</code>: <em>Internal Server Error</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Simple URLs for resources: first a noun for the collection, then the item</strong>. For example <code>/emails</code> and <code>/emails/1234</code>; the former gives you the collection of emails, the second one a specific one identified by its internal id.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Use verbs for special actions</strong>. For example, <code>/search?q=my+keywords</code>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Keep errors simple but verbose (and use HTTP codes)</strong>. We only send something like <code>{ message: "Something terribly wrong happened" }</code> with the proper status code (e.g. <code>401</code> if the call requires authentication) and log more verbose information (origin, error codeâ¦) in the backend for debugging and monitoring.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Relying on HTTP status codes and verbs should already help you keep your API calls and responses lean enough. Less crucial, but still useful:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>JSON first</strong>, then extend to other formats if needed and if time permits.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time">Unix time</a></strong>, or you&rsquo;ll have a bad time.</li>
<li><strong>Prepend your URLs with the API version</strong>, like <code>/v1/emails/1234</code>.</li>
<li><strong>Lowercase everywhere in URLs</strong>.</li>
</ul>

  <div class="entry-content"><h2><a href="/blog/2013/06/19/I-can-haz-init-script.html">I Can Haz Init Script</a></h2>

<p>Something went awfully wrong, and a rogue process is eating up all of the resources on one of your servers. You have no other choice but to restart it. No big deal, really; this is the age of disposable infrastructure after all. Except when it comes back up, everything starts going awry. Half the stuff supposed to be running is down and it&rsquo;s screwing with the rest of your setup.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/y-u-no-guy.png" alt="INIT SCRIPTS, Y U NO LIKE?" /></p>

<p>You don&rsquo;t get to think about them very often, but init scripts are a key piece of a sound, scalable strategy for your infrastructure. It&rsquo;s a <a href="">mandatory best practice</a>. Period. And there are quite a few things in the way of getting them to work properly at scale in production environments. It&rsquo;s a tough world out there.</p>

<h3>What we&rsquo;re dealing withâ¦</h3>

<h4>Packages</h4>

<p>Often enough, you&rsquo;re gonna end up installing a service using the package manager of your distro: <code>yum</code>, <code>apt-get</code>, you name it. These packages usually come with an init script that should get you started.</p>

<p>Sadly, as your architecture grows in complexity, you&rsquo;ll probably run into some walls. Wanna have multiple memcache buckets, or several instances of redis running on the same box? You&rsquo;re out of luck buddy. Time to hack your way
through:</p>

<ul>
<li>Redefine your start logic,</li>
<li>Load one or multiple config files from <code>/etc/defaults</code> or <code>/etc/sysconfig</code>,</li>
<li>Deal with the PIDs, log and lock files,</li>
<li>Implement conditional logic to start/stop/restart one or more of the services,</li>
<li>Realize you&rsquo;ve messed something up,</li>
<li>Same player shoot again.</li>
</ul>


<p>Honestly: PITA.</p>

<h4>Built from source</h4>

<p>First things first: <strong>you shouldn&rsquo;t be building from source</strong> (unless you really, really need to).</p>

<p>Now if you do, you&rsquo;ll have to be thorough: there may be samples of init scripts in there, but you&rsquo;ll have to dig them out. <code>/contrib</code>, <code>/addons</code>, â¦it&rsquo;s never in the same place.</p>

<p>And that makes things &ldquo;fun&rdquo; when you&rsquo;re <a href="http://devo.ps/blog/2013/03/06/troubleshooting-5minutes-on-a-yet-unknown-box.html">trying to unscrew things on a box</a>:</p>

<ul>
<li>You figured out that MySQL is running from <code>/home/user/src/mysql</code>,</li>
<li>You check if there&rsquo;s an init script: no luck this timeâ¦</li>
<li>You try to understand what exactly launched <code>mysqld_safe</code>,</li>
<li>You spend a while digging into the bash history smiling at typos,</li>
<li>You stumble on a <code>run.sh</code> script (uncommented, of course) in the home directory. Funny enough, it seems to be starting everything from MySQL, NGINX and php-fpm to the coffee maker.</li>
<li>You make a mental note to try and track down the &ldquo;genius&rdquo; who did that mess of a job, and get busy with converting everything to a proper init script.</li>
</ul>


<p>Great.</p>

<h3>Why existing solutions suck</h3>

<p>Well, based on what we&rsquo;ve just seen, you really only have two options:</p>

<ol>
<li> <strong>DIY</strong>; but if you&rsquo;re good at what you do, you&rsquo;re probably also lazy. You may do it the first couple times, but that&rsquo;s not gonna scale, especially when dealing with the various flavors of init daemons (upstart, systemdâ¦),</li>
<li> <strong>Use that thing called &ldquo;the Internet&rdquo;</strong>; you read through forum pages, issue queues, gists and if you&rsquo;re lucky you&rsquo;ll find a perfect one (or more likely 10 sucky ones). Kudos to all those of whom shared their work, but you&rsquo;ll probably be back to option 1.</li>
</ol>


<h3>We can do better than this</h3>

<p>You&rsquo;ll find a gazillion websites for pictures of kittens, but as far as I know, there is no authoritative source for init scripts. That&rsquo;s just not right: we have to fix it. A few things I&rsquo;m aiming for:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Scalable</strong>; allow for multiple instances of a service to be started at once from different config files (see the memcache/redis example),</li>
<li><strong>Secure</strong>; ensure <code>configtest</code> is run before a restart/reload (because, you know, a faulty config file preventing the service to restart is kind of a bummer),</li>
<li><strong>Smart</strong>; ensuring for example that the cache is aggressively flushed before restarting your database (so that you don&rsquo;t end-up waiting 50 min for the DB to cleanly shutdown).</li>
</ul>


<p><a href="https://github.com/devo-ps/init-scripts">I&rsquo;ve just created a repo</a> where I&rsquo;ll be dumping various init scripts that will hopefully be helpful to others. I&rsquo;d love to get suggestions or help.</p>

<p>And by the way, things are not much better with applications, though we&rsquo;re trying our best to improve things there too with things like <a href="https://github.com/Unitech/pm2">pm2</a> (fresh and shinny, more about it in a later post).</p>
