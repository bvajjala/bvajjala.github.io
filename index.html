<aside class='notes'>

<p>Hi, my name is Balaji Vajjala and I&rsquo;m the Chief Architect and Technical Cofounder of TaskRabbit. TaskRabbit is a marketplace where neighbors help neighbors get things done.</p>

<p>At TaskRabbit we are using Redis and Resque to do all of our background processing. We&rsquo;ve also gone one step further to use these tools to create an asynchronous message bus system that we call Resque Bus.</p>

<h3>Redis</h3>

<ul>
<li>Key/Value Store</li>
<li>Atomic Operations</li>
</ul>

<aside class='notes'>

<p>I don&rsquo;t have to tell you guys about Redis, but for our purposes the main point is that we can store stuff in it and the operations are atomic.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h1>What is jenkins job builder</h1>

<p>Jenkins job builder is extreme good tool to manage your jenkins CI jobs, it takes simple description from YAML files, and use them to configure jenkins.</p>

<pre><code>#set free style job
#job-template.yml
- job:
    name: testjob
    project-type: freestyle
    defaults: global
    disabled: false
    display-name: 'Fancy job name'
    concurrent: true
    quiet-period: 5
    workspace: /srv/build-area/job-name
    block-downstream: false
    block-upstream: false
</code></pre>

<p>Then put your jenkins access into jenkins.ini file</p>

<pre><code>[jenkins]
user=USERNAME
password=USER_TOKEN
url=JENKINS_URL
ignore_cache=IGNORE_CACHE_FLAG
</code></pre>

<p>Based on the job configuration above, you just need to type command</p>

<pre><code>$ jenkins-jobs --conf jenkins.ini update job-template.yaml 
</code></pre>

<p>Then your job <em>testjob</em> is created in your jenkins server.</p>

<p>The project is created by <a href="https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/InfraTeam">openstack-infrastructure team</a>, it is used to manage the openstack environment, fairly good.</p>

<h1>How it works</h1>

<p>There is no magic behind it, <em>jenkins-jobs</em> just convert the <em>job-template.yaml</em> to jenkins XML request file, and use jenkins remote API to send create request.</p>

<p>Try to do below to understand this.</p>

<pre><code>$ jenkins-jobs test job-template.yaml -o .
</code></pre>

<p>Then xml file <em>testjob</em> is created, see</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?xml version="1.0" ?&gt;
&lt;project&gt;
  &lt;actions/&gt;
  &lt;description&gt;

&amp;lt;!-- Managed by Jenkins Job Builder --&amp;gt;&lt;/description&gt;
  &lt;keepDependencies&gt;false&lt;/keepDependencies&gt;
  &lt;disabled&gt;false&lt;/disabled&gt;
  &lt;displayName&gt;Fancy job name&lt;/displayName&gt;
  &lt;blockBuildWhenDownstreamBuilding&gt;false&lt;/blockBuildWhenDownstreamBuilding&gt;
  &lt;blockBuildWhenUpstreamBuilding&gt;false&lt;/blockBuildWhenUpstreamBuilding&gt;
  &lt;concurrentBuild&gt;true&lt;/concurrentBuild&gt;
  &lt;customWorkspace&gt;/srv/build-area/job-name&lt;/customWorkspace&gt;
  &lt;quietPeriod&gt;5&lt;/quietPeriod&gt;
  &lt;canRoam&gt;true&lt;/canRoam&gt;
  &lt;properties/&gt;
  &lt;scm class="hudson.scm.NullSCM"/&gt;
  &lt;builders/&gt;
  &lt;publishers/&gt;
  &lt;buildWrappers/&gt;
&lt;/project&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Now you can use curl command to send the request (testjob) directly !!</p>

<pre><code>$ curl --user USER:PASS -H "Content-Type: text/xml" -s --data "@testjob" "http://jenkins-server/createItem?name=testjob"
</code></pre>

<h2>How to recreate your jenkins job</h2>

<p>Looks great, finally you need think about how to re-create your jenkins job, it is also simple, just download the config.xml</p>

<pre><code>$ curl --user USER:PASS http://jenkins-server/testjob/config.xml
</code></pre>

<p>Or open the configuration page in broswer *<a href="http://jenkins-server/testjob/configure*">http://jenkins-server/testjob/configure*</a> and map from YAML file.</p>

<p>You need to read <a href="http://ci.openstack.org/jenkins-job-builder/configuration.html">jenkins job builder&rsquo;s guideline</a> to know the map, generate it had level Macro like <a href="https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/InfraTeam">builders</a>, which is connected to the <a href="https://github.com/openstack-infra/jenkins-job-builder/blob/master/jenkins_jobs/modules/builders.py">real python builders module</a> to do transformation from YAML to XML.</p>

<p>What you stated in YAML file like</p>

<pre><code>-job:
  name: test_job
  builders:
- shell: "make test"
</code></pre>

<p>it will be converted to</p>

<pre><code>&lt;builders&gt;
&lt;hudson.tasks.Shell&gt;
  &lt;command&gt;make test&lt;/command&gt;&lt;/hudson.tasks.Shell&gt;
&lt;/builders&gt;
</code></pre>

<h2>How to extend</h2>

<p>Greatly to see jenkins job builder already had lots of default modules to support your normal jenkins jobs, but there is exceptions like some none popular jenkins plugins or your own plugins.</p>

<p>Then it is time to extend the module, the existing document: Extending is not clear enough, I will use example to show how it works, code is in <a href="https://github.com/bv2012/jenkins-buddy">github jenkins-buddy</a> project</p>

<p><a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/ArtifactDeployer+Plugin">ArtifactDeployer</a> Plugin is used as example, this plugin is the popular plugin to deploy the artifacts to other folder.</p>

<p>Artifact Deploy Plugin</p>

<p><img src="../downloads/code/artifactdeploy.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>And I want to have .YAML like below</p>

<pre><code>*#artifactdeploy.yaml*
- job:
name: test-job
publishers:
  - artifactdeployer: 
  includes: 'buddy-*.tar.gz'
  remote: '/project/buddy'
</code></pre>

<h2>write codes to transform</h2>

<p>Now I need to download the existing jobs to see how XML looks like, using curl above, I got it like</p>

<pre><code>&lt;publishers&gt;
   ...  
  &lt;org.jenkinsci.plugins.artifactdeployer.ArtifactDeployerPublisher plugin="artifactdeployer@0.27"&gt;
&lt;entries&gt;
  &lt;org.jenkinsci.plugins.artifactdeployer.ArtifactDeployerEntry&gt;
&lt;includes&gt;buddy-*.tar.gz&lt;/includes&gt;
&lt;basedir&gt;&lt;/basedir&gt;
&lt;excludes&gt;&lt;/excludes&gt;
&lt;remote&gt;/project/buddy&lt;/remote&gt;
&lt;flatten&gt;false&lt;/flatten&gt;
&lt;deleteRemote&gt;false&lt;/deleteRemote&gt;
&lt;deleteRemoteArtifacts&gt;false&lt;/deleteRemoteArtifacts&gt;
&lt;deleteRemoteArtifactsByScript&gt;false&lt;/deleteRemoteArtifactsByScript&gt;
&lt;failNoFilesDeploy&gt;false&lt;/failNoFilesDeploy&gt;
  &lt;/org.jenkinsci.plugins.artifactdeployer.ArtifactDeployerEntry&gt;
&lt;/entries&gt;
&lt;deployEvenBuildFail&gt;false&lt;/deployEvenBuildFail&gt;
  &lt;/org.jenkinsci.plugins.artifactdeployer.ArtifactDeployerPublisher&gt;
..
&lt;/publishers&gt; 
</code></pre>

<p>It belongs the section publishers So I write the jenkins_buddy/modules/publishers.py module to add one function artifactdeployer:</p>

<pre><code>def artifactdeployer(parser, xml_parent, data):
    logger = logging.getLogger("%s:artifactdeployer" % __name__)
    artifactdeployer = XML.SubElement(xml_parent, 'org.jenkinsci.plugins.artifactdeployer.ArtifactDeployerPublisher')
    entries = XML.SubElement(artifactdeployer, 'entries')
    entry = XML.SubElement(entries, 'org.jenkinsci.plugins.artifactdeployer.ArtifactDeployerEntry')
    print data
    XML.SubElement(entry, 'includes').text = data['includes']
    XML.SubElement(entry, 'remote').text = data['remote']
</code></pre>

<p>It is the core part handling convert.</p>

<h3>Hook into jenkins-job builder</h3>

<p>Now you need hook this script into jenkins-jobs builder, thank for the entry_points in python, it can be used for this.</p>

<p>Create the plugin related script and structure, add new entry_point in setup.py</p>

<pre><code>#setup.py in jenkins-buddy
entry_points={
    'jenkins_jobs.publishers': [
    'artifactdeployer=jenkins_buddy.modules.publishers:artifactdeployer',
    ],
}
</code></pre>

<p>it tells jenkins-jobs if you meet new keyword artifactdeployer in publishers, please let me jenkins_buddy.modules.publishers:artifactdeployer to handle.</p>

<h3>Verify it</h3>

<p>Build the pip package local and install it</p>

<pre><code>$ python setup.py sdist
$ pip install dist/jenkins-buddy-0.0.5.zip
</code></pre>

<p>And verify the new job, Bingo, it works.</p>

<pre><code>$ jenkins-jobs test artifactdeploy.yaml -o . 
</code></pre>

<h3>###Make it more complete by checking jenkins plugin java code</h3>

<p>Maybe you noticed, it is hack solution, since I skipped some parameter converting and guess what the XML will look like, if you want to make it more complete, we need to check the java codes directly.</p>

<p>src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/artifactdeployer/ArtifactDeployerPublisher.java is the class we need to take care.</p>

<pre><code>@DataBoundConstructor
public ArtifactDeployerPublisher(List&lt;ArtifactDeployerEntry&gt; deployedArtifact, boolean deployEvenBuildFail) {
    this.entries = deployedArtifact;
    this.deployEvenBuildFail = deployEvenBuildFail;
    if (this.entries == null)
    this.entries = Collections.emptyList();
}
</code></pre>

<p>It is directly mapping from XML into internal data, if you need know more, learn how to develop jenkins plugin.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h1>## Workflow : Deploying/Release Apps from Development to Production  ##</h1>

<p>Deploying is a big part of the lives of most of our Engineering employees. We don&rsquo;t have a release manager and there are no set weekly deploys. Developers and designers are responsible for shipping new stuff themselves as soon as it&rsquo;s ready. This means that deploying needs to be as smooth and safe a process as possible.</p>

<p>The best system we&rsquo;ve found so far to provide this flexibility is to have people deploy branches. Changes never get merged to master until they have been verified to work in production from a branch. This means that master is always stable; a safe point that we can roll back to if there&rsquo;s a problem.</p>

<p>The basic workflow goes like this:</p>

<ul>
<li>Push changes to a branch in GitHub</li>
<li>Wait for the build to pass on our CI server (Jenkins)</li>
<li>Tell Hubot to deploy it</li>
<li>Verify that the changes work and fix any problems that come up</li>
<li>Merge the branch into master
Not too long ago, however, this system wasn&rsquo;t very smart. A branch could accidentally be deployed before the build finished, or even if the build failed. Employees could mistakenly deploy over each other. As the company has grown, we&rsquo;ve needed to add some checks and balances to help us prevent these kinds of mistakes.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Safety First</h2>

<p>The first thing we do now, when someone tries to deploy, is make a call to <a href="https://github.com/github/janky">Janky</a> to determine whether the current CI build is green. If it hasn&rsquo;t finished yet or has failed, we&rsquo;ll tell the deployer to fix the situation and try again.</p>

<p>Next we check whether the application is currently &ldquo;locked&rdquo;. The lock indicates that a particular branch is being deployed in production and that no other deploys of the application should proceed for the moment. Successful builds on the master branch would otherwise get deployed automatically, so we don&rsquo;t want those going out while a branch is being tested. We also don&rsquo;t want another developer to accidentally deploy something while the branch is out.</p>

<p>The last step is to make sure that the branch we&rsquo;re deploying contains the latest commit on master that has made it into production. Once a commit on master has been deployed to production, it should never be “removed” from production by deploying a branch that doesn’t have that commit in it yet.</p>

<p>We use the GitHub API to verify this requirement. An endpoint on the github.com application exposes the SHA1 that is currently running in production. We submit this to the GitHub compare API to obtain the &ldquo;merge base&rdquo;, or the common ancestor, of master and the production SHA1. We can then compare this to the branch that we&rsquo;re attempting to deploy to check that the branch is caught up. By using the common ancestor of master and production, code that only exists on a branch can be removed from production, and changes that have landed on master but haven&rsquo;t been deployed yet won&rsquo;t require branches to merge them in before deploying.</p>

<p>If it turns out the branch is behind, master gets merged into it automatically. We do this using the new :sparkles:Merging API:sparkles: that we&rsquo;re making available today. This merge starts a new CI build like any other push-style event, which starts a deploy when it passes.</p>

<p>At this point the code actually gets deployed to our servers. We usually deploy to all servers for consistency, but a subset of servers can be specified if necessary. This subset can be by functional role — front-end, file server, worker, search, etc. — or we can specify an individual machine by name, e.g, &lsquo;fe7&rsquo;.</p>

<h2>Watch it in action</h2>

<p>What now? It depends on the situation, but as a rule of thumb, small to moderate changes should be observed running correctly in production for at least 15 minutes before they can be considered reasonably stable. During this time we monitor exceptions, performance, tweets, and do any extra verification that might be required. If non-critical tweaks need to be made, changes can be pushed to the branch and will be deployed automatically. In the event that something bad happens, rolling back to master only takes 30 seconds.</p>

<h2>All done!</h2>

<p>If everything goes well, it&rsquo;s time to merge the changes. At GitHub, we use Pull Requests for almost all of our development, so merging typically happens through the pull request page. We detect when the branch gets merged into master and unlock the application. The next deployer can now step up and ship something awesome.</p>

<h1>How do we do it?</h1>

<p>Most of the magic is handled by an internal deployment service called Heaven. At its core, Heaven is a catalog of Capistrano recipes wrapped up in a Sinatra application with a JSON API. Many of our applications are deployed using generic recipes, but more complicated apps can define their own to specify additional deployment steps. Wiring it up to Janky, along with clever use of post-receive hooks and the GitHub API, lets us hack on the niceties over time. Hubot is the central interface to both Janky and Heaven, giving everyone in Campfire great visibility into what’s happening all of the time. As of this writing, 75 individual applications are deployed by Heaven.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h2><a href="/blog/2013/03/22/designing-a-restful-api-that-doesn-t-suck.html">Designing A RESTful API That Doesn&rsquo;t Suck</a></h2>

<p>As we&rsquo;re getting closer to shipping the first version of <a href="http://devo.ps">devo.ps</a> and we are joined by a few new team members, the team took the time to review the few principles we followed when designing our RESTful JSON API. A lot of these can be found on <a href="https://blog.apigee.com/taglist/rest_api_design">apigee&rsquo;s blog</a> (a recommended read). Let me give you the gist of it:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Design your API for developers first</strong>, they are the main users. In that respect, simplicity and intuitivity matter.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol#Request_methods">HTTP verbs</a></strong> instead of relying on parameters (e.g. <code>?action=create</code>). HTTP verbs map nicely with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete">CRUD</a>:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>POST</code> for <em>create</em>,</li>
<li><code>GET</code> for <em>read</em>,</li>
<li><code>DELETE</code> for <em>remove</em>,</li>
<li><code>PUT</code> for <em>update</em> (and <code>PATCH</code> too).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes">HTTP status codes</a></strong>, especially for errors (authentication required, error on the server side, incorrect parameters)… There are plenty to choose from, here are a few:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>200</code>: <em>OK</em></li>
<li><code>201</code>: <em>Created</em></li>
<li><code>304</code>: <em>Not Modified</em></li>
<li><code>400</code>: <em>Bad Request</em></li>
<li><code>401</code>: <em>Unauthorized</em></li>
<li><code>403</code>: <em>Forbidden</em></li>
<li><code>404</code>: <em>Not Found</em></li>
<li><code>500</code>: <em>Internal Server Error</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Simple URLs for resources: first a noun for the collection, then the item</strong>. For example <code>/emails</code> and <code>/emails/1234</code>; the former gives you the collection of emails, the second one a specific one identified by its internal id.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Use verbs for special actions</strong>. For example, <code>/search?q=my+keywords</code>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Keep errors simple but verbose (and use HTTP codes)</strong>. We only send something like <code>{ message: "Something terribly wrong happened" }</code> with the proper status code (e.g. <code>401</code> if the call requires authentication) and log more verbose information (origin, error code…) in the backend for debugging and monitoring.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Relying on HTTP status codes and verbs should already help you keep your API calls and responses lean enough. Less crucial, but still useful:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>JSON first</strong>, then extend to other formats if needed and if time permits.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time">Unix time</a></strong>, or you&rsquo;ll have a bad time.</li>
<li><strong>Prepend your URLs with the API version</strong>, like <code>/v1/emails/1234</code>.</li>
<li><strong>Lowercase everywhere in URLs</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Something went awfully wrong, and a rogue process is eating up all of the resources on one of your servers. You have no other choice but to restart it. No big deal, really; this is the age of disposable infrastructure after all. Except when it comes back up, everything starts going awry. Half the stuff supposed to be running is down and it&rsquo;s screwing with the rest of your setup.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/y-u-no-guy.png" alt="INIT SCRIPTS, Y U NO LIKE?" /></p>

<p>You don&rsquo;t get to think about them very often, but init scripts are a key piece of a sound, scalable strategy for your infrastructure. It&rsquo;s a <a href="">mandatory best practice</a>. Period. And there are quite a few things in the way of getting them to work properly at scale in production environments. It&rsquo;s a tough world out there.</p>

<h3>What we&rsquo;re dealing with…</h3>

<h4>Packages</h4>

<p>Often enough, you&rsquo;re gonna end up installing a service using the package manager of your distro: <code>yum</code>, <code>apt-get</code>, you name it. These packages usually come with an init script that should get you started.</p>

<p>Sadly, as your architecture grows in complexity, you&rsquo;ll probably run into some walls. Wanna have multiple memcache buckets, or several instances of redis running on the same box? You&rsquo;re out of luck buddy. Time to hack your way
through:</p>

<ul>
<li>Redefine your start logic,</li>
<li>Load one or multiple config files from <code>/etc/defaults</code> or <code>/etc/sysconfig</code>,</li>
<li>Deal with the PIDs, log and lock files,</li>
<li>Implement conditional logic to start/stop/restart one or more of the services,</li>
<li>Realize you&rsquo;ve messed something up,</li>
<li>Same player shoot again.</li>
</ul>


<p>Honestly: PITA.</p>

<h4>Built from source</h4>

<p>First things first: <strong>you shouldn&rsquo;t be building from source</strong> (unless you really, really need to).</p>

<p>Now if you do, you&rsquo;ll have to be thorough: there may be samples of init scripts in there, but you&rsquo;ll have to dig them out. <code>/contrib</code>, <code>/addons</code>, …it&rsquo;s never in the same place.</p>

<p>And that makes things &ldquo;fun&rdquo; when you&rsquo;re <a href="http://devo.ps/blog/2013/03/06/troubleshooting-5minutes-on-a-yet-unknown-box.html">trying to unscrew things on a box</a>:</p>

<ul>
<li>You figured out that MySQL is running from <code>/home/user/src/mysql</code>,</li>
<li>You check if there&rsquo;s an init script: no luck this time…</li>
<li>You try to understand what exactly launched <code>mysqld_safe</code>,</li>
<li>You spend a while digging into the bash history smiling at typos,</li>
<li>You stumble on a <code>run.sh</code> script (uncommented, of course) in the home directory. Funny enough, it seems to be starting everything from MySQL, NGINX and php-fpm to the coffee maker.</li>
<li>You make a mental note to try and track down the &ldquo;genius&rdquo; who did that mess of a job, and get busy with converting everything to a proper init script.</li>
</ul>


<p>Great.</p>

<h3>Why existing solutions suck</h3>

<p>Well, based on what we&rsquo;ve just seen, you really only have two options:</p>

<ol>
<li> <strong>DIY</strong>; but if you&rsquo;re good at what you do, you&rsquo;re probably also lazy. You may do it the first couple times, but that&rsquo;s not gonna scale, especially when dealing with the various flavors of init daemons (upstart, systemd…),</li>
<li> <strong>Use that thing called &ldquo;the Internet&rdquo;</strong>; you read through forum pages, issue queues, gists and if you&rsquo;re lucky you&rsquo;ll find a perfect one (or more likely 10 sucky ones). Kudos to all those of whom shared their work, but you&rsquo;ll probably be back to option 1.</li>
</ol>


<h3>We can do better than this</h3>

<p>You&rsquo;ll find a gazillion websites for pictures of kittens, but as far as I know, there is no authoritative source for init scripts. That&rsquo;s just not right: we have to fix it. A few things I&rsquo;m aiming for:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Scalable</strong>; allow for multiple instances of a service to be started at once from different config files (see the memcache/redis example),</li>
<li><strong>Secure</strong>; ensure <code>configtest</code> is run before a restart/reload (because, you know, a faulty config file preventing the service to restart is kind of a bummer),</li>
<li><strong>Smart</strong>; ensuring for example that the cache is aggressively flushed before restarting your database (so that you don&rsquo;t end-up waiting 50 min for the DB to cleanly shutdown).</li>
</ul>


<p><a href="https://github.com/devo-ps/init-scripts">I&rsquo;ve just created a repo</a> where I&rsquo;ll be dumping various init scripts that will hopefully be helpful to others. I&rsquo;d love to get suggestions or help.</p>

<p>And by the way, things are not much better with applications, though we&rsquo;re trying our best to improve things there too with things like <a href="https://github.com/Unitech/pm2">pm2</a> (fresh and shinny, more about it in a later post).</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h2><a href="/blog/2013/06/26/goodbye-node-forever-hello-pm2.html">Goodbye node-forever, hello PM2</a></h2>

<p><img src="http://apps.hemca.com/pm2/pres/pm22.png" alt="pm2 logo" /></p>

<p>It&rsquo;s no secret that the devo.ps team has a crush on Javascript; node.js in the backend, AngularJS for our clients, there isn&rsquo;t much of our stack that isn&rsquo;t at least in part built with it. Our approach of building <a href="http://devo.ps/blog/2013/01/31/farewell-to-regular-web-development-approaches.html">static clients and RESTful JSON APIs</a> means that we run a lot of node.js and I must admit that, despite all of it awesomeness, node.js still is a bit of a
headache when it comes to running in production. Tooling and best practices (think monitoring, logging, error traces…) are still lacking when compared to some of the more established languages.</p>

<p>So far, we had been relying on the pretty nifty <a href="https://github.com/nodejitsu/forever">node-forever</a>. Great tool, but a few things were missing:</p>

<ul>
<li>Limited monitoring and logging abilities,</li>
<li>Poor support for process management configuration,</li>
<li>No support for clusterization,</li>
<li>Aging codebase (which meant frequent failures when upgrading Node).</li>
</ul>


<p>This is what led us to write <a href="https://github.com/Unitech/pm2">PM2</a> in the past couple months. We thought we&rsquo;d give you a quick look at it while we&rsquo;re nearing a production ready release.</p>

<h3>So what&rsquo;s in the box?</h3>

<p>First things first, you can install it with <code>npm</code>:</p>

<pre><code>npm install -g pm2
</code></pre>

<p>Let&rsquo;s open things up with the usual comparison table:</p>

<p>FeatureForeverPM2</p>

<p>Keep Alive</p>

<p>✔</p>

<p>✔</p>

<p>Coffeescript</p>

<p>✔</p>

<p>Log aggregation</p>

<p>✔</p>

<p>API</p>

<p>✔</p>

<p>Terminal monitoring</p>

<p>✔</p>

<p>Clustering</p>

<p>✔</p>

<p>JSON configuration</p>

<p>✔</p>

<p>And now let me geek a tad more about the main features…</p>

<h3>Native clusterization</h3>

<p>Node v0.6 introduced the cluster feature, allowing you to share a socket across multiple networked Node applications. Problem is, it doesn&rsquo;t work out of the box and requires some tweaking to handle master and children processes.</p>

<p>PM2 handles this natively, without any extra code: PM2 itself will act as the master process and wrap your code into a special clustered process, as Nodejs does, to add some global variables to your files.</p>

<p>To start a clustered app using all the CPUs you just need to type something like that:</p>

<pre><code>$ pm2 start app.js -i max
</code></pre>

<p>Then;</p>

<pre><code>$ pm2 list
</code></pre>

<p>Which should display something like (ASCII UI FTW);</p>

<p><img src="http://apps.hemca.com/pm2/pres/pm2-list.png" alt="pm2 list" /></p>

<p>As you can see, your app is now forked into multiple processes depending on the number of CPUs available.</p>

<h3>Monitoring <em>a la</em> termcaps-HTOP</h3>

<p>It&rsquo;s nice enough to have an overview of the running processes and their status with the <code>pm2 list</code> command. But what about tracking their resources consumption? Fear not:</p>

<pre><code>$ pm2 monit
</code></pre>

<p>You should get the CPU usage and memory consumption by process (and cluster).</p>

<p><img src="http://apps.hemca.com/pm2/pres/pm2-monit.png" alt="pm2 monit" /></p>

<p><strong>Disclaimer</strong>: <a href="https://github.com/arunoda/node-usage">node-usage</a> doesn&rsquo;t support MacOS for now (feel free to PR). It works just fine on Linux though.</p>

<p>Now, what about checking on our clusters and GC cleaning of the memory stack?
Let&rsquo;s consider you already have an HTTP benchmark tool (if not, you should definitely check <a href="https://github.com/wg/wrk">WRK</a>):</p>

<pre><code>$ express bufallo     // Create an express app
$ cd bufallo
$ npm install
$ pm2 start app.js -i max
$ wrk -c 100 -d 100 http://localhost:3000/
</code></pre>

<p>In another terminal, launch the monitoring option:</p>

<pre><code>$ pm2 monit
</code></pre>

<p>W00t!</p>

<h3>Realtime log aggregation</h3>

<p>Now you have to manage multiple clustered processes: one who&rsquo;s crawling data, another who is processing stuff, and so on so forth. That means logs, lots of it. You can still handle it the old fashioned way:</p>

<pre><code>$ tail -f /path/to/log1 /path/to/log2 ...
</code></pre>

<p>But we&rsquo;re nice, so we wrote the <code>logs</code> feature:</p>

<pre><code>$ pm2 logs
</code></pre>

<p><img src="http://apps.hemca.com/pm2/pres/pm2-logs.png" alt="pm2 monit" /></p>

<h3>Resurrection</h3>

<p>So things are nice and dandy, your processes are humming and you need to do a hard restart. What now? Well, first, dump things:</p>

<pre><code>$ pm2 dump
</code></pre>

<p>From there, you should be able to resurrect things from file:</p>

<pre><code>$ pm2 kill     // let's simulate a pm2 stop
$ pm2 resurect // All my processes are now up and running 
</code></pre>

<h3>API Health point</h3>

<p>Let&rsquo;s say you want to monitor all the processes managed by PM2, as well as the status of the machine they run on (and maybe even build a nice Angular app to consume this API…):</p>

<pre><code>$ pm2 web
</code></pre>

<p>Point your browser at <code>http://localhost:9615</code>, aaaaand… done!</p>

<h3>And there&rsquo;s more…</h3>

<ul>
<li>Full tests,</li>
<li>Generation of <code>update-rc.d</code> (<code>pm2 startup</code>), though still very alpha,</li>
<li>Development mode with auto restart on file change (<code>pm2 dev</code>), still very drafty too,</li>
<li>Log flushing,</li>
<li>Management of your applications fleet via JSON file,</li>
<li>Log uncaught exceptions in error logs,</li>
<li>Log of restart count and time,</li>
<li>Automated killing of processes exiting too fast.</li>
</ul>


<h3>What&rsquo;s next?</h3>

<p>Well first, you could show your love on Github (we love stars):
<a href="https://github.com/Unitech/pm2">https://github.com/Unitech/pm2</a>.</p>

<p>We developed PM2 to offer an advanced and complete solution for Node process management. We&rsquo;re looking forward to getting more people helping us getting there: pull requests are more than welcome. A few things already on the
roadmap that we&rsquo;ll get right at once we have a stable core:</p>

<ul>
<li>Remote administration/status checking,</li>
<li>Built-in inter-processes communication channel (message bus),</li>
<li>V8 GC memory leak detection,</li>
<li>Web interface,</li>
<li>Persistent storage for monitoring data,</li>
<li>Email notifications.</li>
</ul>

  <div class="entry-content"><h2><a href="/blog/2013/07/03/ansible-simply-kicks-ass.html">Ansible Simply Kicks Ass</a></h2>

<p>The devo.ps team has been putting quite a few tools to the test over the years when it comes to managing infrastructures. We&rsquo;ve developed some ourselves and have adopted others. While the choice to use one over another is not always as clear-cut as we&rsquo;d like (I&rsquo;d love to rant about monitoring but will leave that for a later post), we&rsquo;ve definitely developed kind of a crush for <a href="https://github.com/ansible/ansible">Ansible</a> in the past 6 months. We went through years of using Puppet, then Chef and more recently Salt Stack, before Ansible gained unanimous adoption among our team.</p>

<p>What makes it awesome? Well, on top of my head:</p>

<ul>
<li>It&rsquo;s <strong>agent-less</strong> and works by default in <strong>push mode</strong> (that last point is subjective, I know).</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s <strong>easy to pick up</strong> (honestly, try and explain Chef or Puppet to a developer and see how long that takes you compared to Ansible).</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s <strong>just Python</strong>. It makes it easier for people like me to contribute (Ruby is not necessarily that mainstream among ops) and also means minimal dependency on install (Python is shipped by default with Linux).</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s <strong>picking up steam</strong> at an impressive pace (I believe we&rsquo;re at 10 to 15 pull requests a day).</li>
<li>And it has all of the good stuff: idempotence, roles, playbooks, tasks, handlers, lookups, callback plugins…</li>
</ul>


<p>Now, Ansible is still very much in its infancy and some technologies may not yet be supported. But there are a great deal of teams pushing hard on contributions, including us. In the past few weeks, for example, we&rsquo;ve
contributed both Digital Ocean and Linode modules. And we have a lot more coming, including some experimentations with Vagrant.</p>

<p>Now, an interesting aspect of Ansible, and one that makes it so simple, is that it comes by default with a tool-belt. Understand that it is shipped with a range of modules that add support for well known technologies: <a href="http://www.ansibleworks.com/docs/modules.html">EC2,
Rackspace, MySQL, PostgreSQL, rpm, apt,…</a>. This now includes our
Linode contribution. That means that with the latest version of Ansible you can spin off a new Linode box as easily as:</p>

<pre><code>ansible all -m linode -a "name='my-linode-box' plan=1 datacenter=2 distribution=99 password='p@ssword' "
</code></pre>

<p>Doing this with Chef would probably mean chasing down a knife plugin for adding Linode support, and would simply require a full Chef stack (say hello to RabbitMQ, Solr, CouchDB and a gazillion smaller dependencies). Getting
Ansible up and running is as easy as:</p>

<pre><code>pip install ansible
</code></pre>

<p>Et voila! You gotta appreciate the simple things in life. Especially the life of a sysadmin.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h2><a href="/blog/2013/07/11/code-reuse-with-nodejs.html">Code Reuse With Node.js</a></h2>

<p><img src="http://devo.ps/images/posts/recycle.png" alt="Code recycling" /></p>

<p>Any project that grows to a decent size will need to re-use parts of its code extensively. That often means, through the development cycle, a fair amount of rewrites and refactoring exercises. Elegant code re-use is hard to pull off.</p>

<p>With node.js, which we use quite a bit at <a href="http://devo.ps">devo.ps</a>, the most common ways to do this often rely on prototype or class inheritance. The problem is, as the inheritance chain grows, managing attributes and functions
can become quite complex.</p>

<p>The truth is, people usually just need the objects. This led us to adopt a certain form of object-based prototyping. We believe it to be leaner and more straightforward in most cases. But before we get there, let&rsquo;s have a look at how people usually approach this issue.</p>

<h2>The &ldquo;Function copy&rdquo;</h2>

<p>Usually in the form of <code>this[key] = that[key]</code>. A quick example:</p>

<pre><code>var objectA = {
    lorem: 'lorem ipsum'
};
var objectB = {};

// Direct copy of a string, but you get the idea
objectB.lorem = objectA.lorem;
console.log(objectB); // Will output: { lorem: 'lorem ipsum' }
</code></pre>

<p>Crude, but it works. Next…</p>

<h2>Object.defineProperties()</h2>

<p>The previous method may work with simple structures, but it won&rsquo;t hold when
your use cases become more complex. That&rsquo;s when I usually call my buddy
<code>Object.defineProperties()</code>:</p>

<pre><code>var descriptor = Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor;
var defineProp = Object.defineProperty;

var objectA = {};
var objectB = {};
var objectC = {};

objectA.__defineGetter__('lorem', function() {
    return 'lorem ipsum';
});
console.log(objectA); // Will output: { lorem: [Getter] }

// Direct copy, which copies the result of the getter.
objectB.lorem = objectA.lorem;
console.log(objectB); // Will output: { lorem: 'lorem ipsum' }

// Copying with Object.defineProperty(), and it copies the getter itself.
defineProp(objectC, 'lorem', descriptor(objectA, 'lorem'));
console.log(objectC); // Will output: { lorem: [Getter] }
</code></pre>

<p>I often use a library for that. A couple examples (more or less the same stuff
with different coding styles):</p>

<ol>
<li><p> <strong><a href="https://github.com/medikoo/es5-ext">es5-ext</a></strong></p>

<p> var extend = require(&lsquo;es5-ext/lib/Object/extend-properties&rsquo;);</p>

<p> var objectA = {};
 var objectC = {};</p>

<p> objectA.<strong>defineGetter</strong>(&lsquo;lorem&rsquo;, function() {
     return &lsquo;lorem ipsum&rsquo;;
 });</p>

<p> extend(objectC, objectA);
 console.log(objectC); // Will output: { lorem: [Getter] }</p></li>
<li><p> <strong><a href="https://github.com/devo-ps/carcass">Carcass</a></strong></p>

<p> var carcass = require(&lsquo;carcass&rsquo;);</p>

<p> var objectA = {};
 var objectC = {};</p>

<p> objectA.<strong>defineGetter</strong>(&lsquo;lorem&rsquo;, function() {
     return &lsquo;lorem ipsum&rsquo;;
 });</p>

<p> carcass.mixable(objectC);
 objectC.mixin(objectA);
 console.log(objectC); // Will output: { mixin: [Function: mixin], lorem: [Getter] }</p></li>
</ol>


<p>Slightly better, but not optimal. Now, let&rsquo;s see what we end up doing more and
more often:</p>

<h2>Prototyping through objects</h2>

<p>The basic idea is that we prepare some functions, wrap them into an object which then becomes a &ldquo;feature&rdquo;. That feature can then be re-used by simply merging it with the targeted structure (object or prototype).</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s take the example of the <a href="https://github.com/devo-ps/carcass/blob/master/lib/proto/loaderSync.js">loaderSync</a> script in <a href="https://github.com/devo-ps/carcass">Carcass</a>:</p>

<pre><code>module.exports = {
    source: source,
    parser: parser,
    reload: reload,
    get: get
};

function get() {

(...)
</code></pre>

<p>Once you copy the functions to an object, this object becomes a &ldquo;loader&rdquo; that can load a &ldquo;source&rdquo; synchronously with a &ldquo;parser&rdquo;. A &ldquo;source&rdquo; can be a file path and the &ldquo;parser&rdquo; can be simply Node.js&#8217; <code>require</code> function.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s now see how to use this with a couple object builders. Once again, I&rsquo;ll borrow an example from Carcass; the <a href="https://github.com/devo-ps/carcass/blob/master/benchmark/proto.loaderSync.js">loaderSync benchmark script</a>. The first builder generates a function and copies the methods from what we&rsquo;ve prepared. The second one copies the methods to the prototype of a builder class:</p>

<pre><code>(...)

function LoaderA(_source) {
    function loader() {
        return loader.get();
    }
    loader.mixin = mixin;
    loader.mixin(loaderSync);
    loader.source(_source);
    return loader;
}

(...)

function LoaderC(_source) {
    if (!(this instanceof LoaderC)) return new LoaderC(_source);
    this.source(_source);
}
LoaderC.prototype.mixin = mixin;
LoaderC.prototype.mixin(loaderSync);

(...)
</code></pre>

<p>Here we can see the two approaches. Let&rsquo;s compare them quickly:</p>

<p>FeatureLoader ALoader C</p>

<p><strong>Instantiating</strong>
<code>var a = LoaderA(...)</code></p>

<p><code>var c = LoaderC(...)</code> or <code>var c = new LoaderC(...)</code></p>

<p><strong>Appearance</strong>
Generates a function</p>

<p>Builds a typical instance which is an object.</p>

<p><strong>Invoking directly</strong>
<code>a()</code> or <code>a.get()</code></p>

<p><code>c.get()</code></p>

<p><strong>Invoking as a callback</strong>
<code>ipsum(a)</code></p>

<p><code>ipsum(c.get.bind(c))</code></p>

<h2><strong>Performance † of instantiating</strong></h2>

<p>100x faster</p>

<p><strong>Performance of invoking</strong>
<em>idem</em></p>

<p><em>idem</em></p>

<p><strong>†</strong>: (check it yourself by <a href="https://github.com/devo-ps/carcass/blob/master/Makefile">benchmarking Carcass with <code>make bm</code></a>)</p>

<h3>&ldquo;Protos&rdquo; and beyond</h3>

<p>That last approach is gaining traction among our team; we prepare functions for our object builders (which, by the way, we call &ldquo;protos&rdquo;). While we still choose to use prototypes in some occurrences, it is mainly because it is
faster to get done. For the sake of convenience, we also sometimes rely on functions rather than objects to invoke our &ldquo;protos&rdquo;, however keep in mind that this is a performance trade-off.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll wrap this up mentioning one more method we use, admittedly less often: &ldquo;Object alter&rdquo;. The idea is to rely on an &ldquo;alter&rdquo; function designed to change objects passed to it. This is sometimes also called a &ldquo;mixin&rdquo;. An example from <a href="https://github.com/visionmedia/configurable.js">vsionmedia&rsquo;s trove of awesomeness on Github</a>:</p>

<pre><code>(...)

module.exports = function(obj){

    obj.settings = {};

    obj.set = function(name, val){
        (...)
    };

    (...)

    return obj;
};
</code></pre>

<p>I&rsquo;ll admit that the devo.ps team is a lazy bunch; we like to forget about things, especially the hard stuff. Dealing with a complex process invariably leads one of us to vent about how &ldquo;we should automate that stuff&rdquo;. That&rsquo;s what our team does day and night:</p>

<li> Dumb things down, lower barriers of entry, and then…</li>
<li> <strong>Automate all the things!</strong></li>
</ol>


<p>This has transpired through every layer of our company, from engineering to operations. Recently we&rsquo;ve started pushing on a third point, but first let me rant a bit…</p>

<h3>The ever increasing surface of friction</h3>

<p>The past few years have seen a healthy push on UI and UX. Even developer tools and enterprise software, historically less user-friendly, have started adopting that trend. We now have things like Github. Great.</p>

<p>This trend grew in parallel with the adoption of SaaS. SaaS are the results of teams focused on specific problems, with the user experience often being a key component (not to undervalue good engineering). It&rsquo;s pretty standard for these services to offer an API for integration&rsquo;s sake. <a href="https://getbase.com">Our CRM</a> plays nicely with Dropbox, GMail and a gazillion other services. Again, great.</p>

<p><strong>However, the success of SaaS means the surface of interfaces we&rsquo;re dealing with is constantly stretching. This is far more difficult to overcome than poor UI or UX.</strong> Many of us have witnessed teams struggling to get adoption on a great tool that happen to be one too many. There&rsquo;s not much you can do about it.</p>

<h3>A bot to rule them all…</h3>

<p><img src="http://devo.ps/images/posts/borat.png" alt="Borat is omnipotent" /></p>

<p>Our team has tried a lot of different approaches over the years. We kicked the tires on a lot of products and ended up doing as usual:</p>

<ol>
<li><p> <strong>Simplify</strong>. For example, we use Github to manage most tasks and discussions, including operations (HR, admin, …), and marketing. We used <a href="http://trello.com/">Trello</a> alongside Github for a while and we loved it. But it silo-ed the discussions. Everything from our employee handbook to tasks for buying snacks for the office are now on Github. It also had an interesting side effect on transparency, but I&rsquo;ll talk about this another time.</p></li>
<li><p> <strong>Automate</strong>. We automate pretty much everything we can. When you apply to one of our job by email for example, we push the attachments in Dropbox (likely your resume) and create a ticket with the relevant information on Github. <a href="http://zapier.com">Zapier</a> is great for this kind of stuff by the way.</p></li>
<li><p> <strong>Make it accessible</strong>. That&rsquo;s the most important point for us at this stage. Borat, our <a href="http://hubot.github.com">Hubot</a> chat bot, is hooked up with most of our infrastructure and is able to pass on requests to the services we use as well as some of our automation. If one of us is awake, chances are you can find us on the chat, making it the most ubiquitous interface for our team:</p>

<ul>
<li>Need to deploy some code on production or modify some configuration on a server? Ask Borat, he&rsquo;ll relay your demands to the <a href="http://devo.ps">devo.ps</a> API.</li>
<li>Your latest commit broke the build? A new mail came from support? Expect to hear about it from Borat.</li>
<li>Need to use our time tracker? Just drop a message to the bot when you&rsquo;re starting your task and let him know when you&rsquo;re done.</li>
<li>Need to call for a SCRUM? Just mention the Github team you want to chat with and Borat will create a separate channel and invite the right people to join.</li>
<li>Somebody is at the door? Ask the bot to open it for you (you gotta love hacking on Raspberry PI).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>


<p>Anybody with access to our bot&rsquo;s repository can add a script to hook him up to a new service. Git push, kill the bot and wait for him to come back to life with new skills. The tedious stuff ends up sooner or later scripted and one sentence away.</p>

<p>Really, try it. It&rsquo;s worth the investment.</p>
