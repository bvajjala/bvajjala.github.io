  <div class="entry-content"><p>
  <span>In February, I had the pleasure of speaking at LocalUser Group about some of our experiences with continuous delivery and deployment here. The slides for this </span><a target="_blank" href="http://bvajjala.github.io/blog/2014/04/21/practical-continuous-deployment/slides/#/">are available online</a><span>, but the talk generated a lot of discussion at the time and I&#8217;d like to recap some of it here.</span>
</p>


<p>
  To give a bit of context, I work in the business platform team; we&#8217;re responsible for developing the tools that allow the business to interact with the customer. In particular, we develop the order management tools such as HAMS (hosted account management system) and MAC (my.atlassian.com); if you&#8217;ve ever bought or evaluated our products, these are the systems that have been doing the work in the background. As we grow, these systems need to undergo a lot of changes, so we need to speed up our delivery of improvements and features. To do this, we&#8217;re moving to a continuous delivery and deployment model for all of our business tools, which will allow us to get improvements out to our customers (both internal and external) faster.
</p>


<h2>Integration vs. deployment vs. delivery</h2>


<p>
  Before we start, I should probably clarify what I mean by <em>continuous integration, delivery, </em>and<em> deployment</em>. The terms are often used interchangeably, but they have different meanings for our purposes:
</p>


<h3>Continuous integration</h3>


<p>
  The process of automatically building and testing your software on a regular basis. How regularly this occurs varies; in the early days of agile this meant daily builds, however, with the rise of CI tools like Bamboo/Jenkins, this can be as often as every commit. In the business systems team we build and run full unit and integration tests of every commit to every branch using Bamboo&#8217;s/Jenkins branch-build feature.
</p>


<h3>Continuous delivery</h3>


<p>
  A logical step forward from continuous integration. If your tests are run constantly, and you trust your tests to provide a guarantee of quality, then it becomes possible to release your software at any point in time. Note that continuous delivery does not always entail actually delivering as your customers may not need or want constant updates. Instead, it represents a philosophy and a commitment to ensuring that your code is always in a release-ready state.
</p>


<h3>Continuous deployment</h3>


<p>
  The ultimate culmination of this process; it&#8217;s the actual delivery of features and fixes to the customer as soon as they are ready. It usually refers to cloud and SaaS, as these are the most amenable to being silently updated in the background. But some desktop software offers this in the form of optional beta and nightly updates such as Mozilla&#8217;s <a target="_blank" href="http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/channel/#beta">beta and aurora</a> Firefox channels, for example.
</p>


<p>
  In practice there&#8217;s a continuous spectrum of options between these techniques, ranging from just running tests regularly, to a completely automated deployment pipeline from commit to the customer. The constant theme through all of them, however, is a commitment to constant QA and testing, and a level of test coverage that imparts confidence in the readiness of your software for delivery.
</p>


<h2>So why would you bother?</h2>


<p>
  When bringing up the subject of continuous deployment adoption, there will inevitably (and rightly) be questions about what the benefits of the of the model are. For the business platforms team the main drivers were:
</p>


<ul>
  <li>
    We want to move to feature-based releases rather than a weekly &ldquo;whatever happens to be ready&rdquo; release. This is allows faster and finer-grained upgrades, and assists debugging and regression detection by only changing one thing at a time.
  </li>
  <li>
    The weekly release process was only semi-automated; While we have build tools such as Maven to perform the steps, the actual process of cutting a new release was driven by developers, following instructions on a Confluence page. By automating every step of the process we make it self documenting and repeatable.
  </li>
  <li>
    Similarly, the actual process of getting the software onto our servers was semi automated; we had detailed scripts to upgrade servers, but running these required coordination with the sysadmin team, who already had quite enough work to be going on with. By making the deployment to the servers fully automated and driven by Bamboo rather than by humans, we created a repeatable deployment process and freed the sysadmins of busywork.
  </li>
  <li>
    By automating the release and deployment process, we can constantly release ongoing work to staging and QA servers, giving visibility of the state of development.
  </li>
</ul>


<p>
  But these benefits are driven by our internal processes; When advocating for adopting continuous deployment, you&#8217;ll often receive requests for justification from other stakeholders in your company. Continuous deployment bring benefits to them, too:
</p>


<ul>
  <li> 
    <em>To customers</em>: By releasing features when they&#8217;re ready rather than waiting for a fixed upgrade window, customers will get them faster. By releasing constantly to a staging server while developing them, customers have visibility of the changes and can be part of the development process.
  </li>
  <li>
    <em>To management</em>: When we release more often, managers will see the result of work sooner and progress will be visible.
  </li>
  <li>
    <em>To developers</em>: This removes the weekly/monthly/whatever mad dash to get changes into the release window. If a developer needs a few more hours to make sure a feature is fully working, then the feature will go out a few hours later, not a when the next release window opens.
  </li>
  <li>
    <em>To sysadmins</em>: Not only will sysadmins not have to perform the releases themselves, but the change to small, discrete feature releases will allow easier detection of what changes affected the system adversely.
  </li>
</ul>


<p>
  The last point should probably be expanded upon, as it is such a powerful concept. If your release process bundles multiple features together, it becomes much harder to nail down exactly what caused regressions in the system. Consider the following scenario: On a Monday, a release is performed with the changes that were made the previous week. Shortly afterwards, however, the sysadmin team notices a large increase in load on the database server. While triaging the issue they notice the following changes were included:
</p>


<ul>
  <li>
    Developer A added a new AJAX endpoint for the order process.
  </li>
  <li>
    Developer B added a column to a table in the database.
  </li>
  <li>
    Developer C upgraded the version of the database driver in the application.
  </li>
</ul>


<p>
  Identifying which one is the cause would require investigation, possibly to the point of reverting changes or running <a target="_blank" href="http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Tools-Debugging-with-Git">git bisect</a>. However, if each change is released separately, the start of the performance regression can be easily correlated with the release of each feature, especially if your release process <a target="_blank" href="http://codeascraft.com/2010/12/08/track-every-release/">tags each release in your monitoring system</a>.
</p>


<h2>So how do you actually, you know, <em>do it</em>?</h2>


<p>
  Continuous deployment guides frequently focus on the culture and adoption aspects of it (as indeed this one has so far). What&#8217;s less common to see are practical nuts-and-bolts issues being addressed. For the rest of this post I&#8217;ll attempt to address some of the practical hurdles we had to jump while transitioning to continuous deployment.
</p>


<p>
  It&#8217;s worth noting that everything here should be treated as a starting point rather than a set of rules; Much of what I cover is still actively being changed as we discover new ways of working and new requirements. In particular, the development process is still being actively tweaked as we find out what works best for us. Processes should serve the goals, not the other way around.
</p>


<p>
  While we&#8217;re using Atlassian tools wherever possible, none of this is necessarily Atlassian specific, however, our tools do have some nice integrations and I&#8217;ll point these out where appropriate.
</p>


<h2>Development workflow</h2>


<p>
  Continuous deployment implies a clearer development process, with your main release branch always being in a releasable state. There are any number of methodologies that allow this and I won&#8217;t cover them all here, but if you want a deep dive into them I would recommend the book <a target="_blank" href="http://continuousdelivery.com/"><span>Continuous Delivery</span> by Jez Humble and David Farley</a>. As mentioned above, the model we follow is &ldquo;release by feature&rdquo;; every distinct change we wish to make results in a separate release, containing only that change. What I&#8217;ll outline briefly here is our current workflow and the tools we&#8217;re using to enable it.
</p>


<h3>#1: Use an issue tracker for everything</h3>


<p>
  For every bug, feature request, or other change, we create a unique ticket. If this is part of an ongoing project, we&#8217;ll use a parent epic, and for smaller chunks of work, we&#8217;ll use a sub-task. Obviously all this is best practice anyway, but in our case we use the issue IDs generated to track the change from concept to deployment. This is important as having a single reference point makes it easier to track the state of work, and enables some of the tool integrations I&#8217;ll describe below. As you may have guessed, we use JIRA for this purpose.
</p>


<h3>
  #2: Create a separate branch for this work, tagged with the issue number
</h3>


<p>
  In your version control system, create a branch which contains the issue number and a short description of the change; e.g. &ldquo;BIZPLAT-64951-remove-smtp-logging&rdquo;. It should hopefully go without saying at this point that you should be using a <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_revision_control#Systems">DVCS</a> for this work. Older version control systems such as Subversion make branching and merging difficult, and without the ability to separate work into streams, keeping the main branch pristine rapidly becomes unwieldy.
</p>


<p>
  We use Git for version control, and Stash to manage our repositories. JIRA has a useful integration point here; from within the tracking issue we created in #1 we can just press a button and Stash will create a branch for us. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/sourcetree/overview">SourceTree</a> also has the ability to pick-up and checkout these new branches. JIRA also has the ability to query Stash and list all branches associated with a given issue in the issue itself, along with number of commits to the branch. This turns your JIRA ticket into a convenient dashboard for the state of your development.
</p>


<h3>#3: Develop on this branch, and continuously test and integrate it</h3>


<p>
  Git allows you to easily make many commits on a branch, and then only merge when ready &ndash; but while working on this branch you should be constantly running your test system. We run our full integration test suite against every commit on all active branches.  We use Bamboo to do this; in particular we use its <a target="_blank" href="http://blogs.atlassian.com/2012/04/bamboofeature-branch-continuous-integration-hg-git/">plan branch</a> feature to automatically create the necessary build configuration.
</p>


<p>
  Again, there are useful integration points here. One is that, as with the branches and commits, JIRA can display the state of any branch plans associated with tickets, creating an at-a-glance view of the feature development. But a more powerful one (in my opinion) is that Bamboo can also inform Stash of the state of builds for a branch. Why that is so important becomes evident when we come to pull requests in step #4.
</p>


<h3>#3.1: Optional: Push your changes to a rush box</h3>


<p>
  <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dailies">Rush boxes</a> are used as staging servers for ongoing work that is not yet ready for QA or staging. This step is particularly useful when you have a customer involved in the development of the feature. By pushing out work in progress to a viewable stage environment you give them visibility of changes and allow them to review.
</p>


<p>
  A version of this is to do this automatically using the same infrastructure tooling you use to perform your deployments below to also push to the staging server. In extreme cases, you can actually create dedicated staging infrastructure (e.g at AWS) at the same time that you create the feature branch. We haven&#8217;t got to this stage yet, but it&#8217;s definitely on my &ldquo;cool stuff I&#8217;d like to do&rdquo; list.
</p>


<h3>#4: When ready, create a pull request for the branch</h3>


<p>
  Pull requests are the DVCS world&#8217;s version of <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_review">code review</a>. Inexperienced developers tend to dislike the idea, but many experienced developers love them, as they provide a safety net when working on critical code and infrastructure.
</p>


<p>
  On our team we have a &ldquo;no direct merge/commit to master&rdquo; rule  that we enforce through Stash access controls. This means that all merges must come through a pull request. On top of this we define a couple of extra quality rules:
</p>


<ul>
  <li>
    All pull requests must have approval from at least one reviewer
  </li>
  <li>
    The Bamboo tests for this branch must pass.
  </li>
</ul>


<p>
  Both of these are enforced by Stash; in particular, the second one is enforced by the Bamboo to Stash pass/fail notification mentioned in #3.
</p>


<h3>#5: Merge and release</h3>


<p>
  Once the pull request has passed, the merge to the release branch can be performed. At this point we perform full release of the software; we use a separate dedicated Bamboo build plan for this, which first runs the full test suite before bumping the version and pushing to our build repository.
</p>


<h3>#6: Deploy to staging</h3>


<p>
  For us, this stage is also fully automated. The build of a release version of the software triggers its automatic deployment to our pre-production staging servers. This allows additional QA to be performed on it, and possible review by customers or other interested parties.
</p>


<p>
  The actual nuts and bolts of how we perform these deployments will be covered below.
</p>


<h3>#7: Promote to production</h3>


<p>
  One of our rules is that we never push builds directly out to production. The binaries that go to production are the exact same ones that have been through QA on our staging servers. Thus we don&#8217;t so much release to production as <em>promote</em> once we&#8217;re happy with the quality. Again, the mechanics of this will be covered in more detail below, but suffice to say that we use Bamboo to manage which builds are deployed to where, and Bamboo communicates this information back to JIRA where it can be displayed against the original feature request.
</p>


<h2>Some full disclosure about integration</h2>


<p>
  While I&#8217;ve pointed out a number of places where Atlassian products integrate together, the spirit of <em><a target="_blank" href="https://www.atlassian.com/company/about/values">open company, no bullshit</a></em> compels me to point out that these integration points are not just available to Atlassian tools. This interoperability is enabled by REST APIs that are <a target="_blank" href="https://developer.atlassian.com/display/DOCS/REST+API+Development">documented online</a>, so it&#8217;s perfectly possible enable these features with a little work, possibly via <a target="_blank" href="http://curl.haxx.se/">curl</a>. For example, if you&#8217;re using <a target="_blank" href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/stash">Stash</a> for Git management but are still using Jenkins for CI, you can still enable the build-status integration mentioned in step #3 but calling out to the Stash <a target="_blank" href="https://developer.atlassian.com/stash/docs/latest/how-tos/updating-build-status-for-commits.html">build status API</a>.
</p>


<p>
  However, the spirit of keeping marketing off my back and wanting to get paid compels me to point out that this is all a lot easier using our products together. 
</p>


<h2>Segue: Continuous downtime?</h2>


<p>
  It&#8217;s worth noting at this point that with continuous deployment also comes the possibility of continuous downtime. If you&#8217;re releasing infrequently, you can often get away with the occasional outage for upgrades, but if you get to the point where you&#8217;re releasing features several times a day, this quickly becomes unacceptable. Thus continuous deployment goes hand-in-hand with a need for clustering, failover, and other high-availability infrastructure.
</p>


<p>
  We went through this process, too. Earlier versions of our order systems were running a single instance for a largely historical reason, and prior to moving to the new development model we had been following a weekly release cycle, with the deployment happening on a Monday morning. This infrequency, along with the fact that the deployment happened in Australian business hours, meant that this didn&#8217;t affect customers unduly. Not that we were <em>proud</em> of this downtime, but it was never a sufficient pain point for us to invest the work necessary to turn this into a truly clustered system. But the move to continuous deployment meant we had to address this deficiency, splitting out the stateful parts of the order system (such as batch-processing) and clustering the critical parts.
</p>


<p>
  One additional point to note when clustering systems is that it&#8217;s important to select components of your network stack that will work with your deployment automation tools. For example, our original HA (high-availability) stack used Apache with <a target="_blank" href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/mod_proxy_balancer.html">mod_proxy_balancer</a>. However, while theoretically this can be automated via HTTP calls to the management front-end, in practice it was never built with this in mind and proved unreliable. In the end we moved our critical services behind a <a target="_blank" href="http://haproxy.1wt.eu/">HAProxy</a> cluster, which provides a reliable (albeit Unix-socket based) API for managing cluster members.
</p>


<h2>The last mile problem</h2>


<p>
  Another issue I seldom see addressed is how to actually get the software onto your servers; it&#8217;s assumed that if you&#8217;re doing continuous deployment you already have the &ldquo;deployment&rdquo; part taken care of. But even if this is the case, your existing tools may not necessarily fit with a fully automated deployment pipeline rather than a fixed-window schedule. I refer to this as the <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_mile">&lsquo;last mile&#8217;</a> problem. On the business platforms team we had this issue: We had a set of Python tools that had been in use for several years that performed upgrades on our hosts. However they were not end-to-end automated, and had no concept of cross-host coordination; rather than perform a rewrite of these scripts, we decided to look around for newer options.
</p>


<p>
  One option that may be possible in simple single-server cases is to use your Bamboo agents themselves as the last mile system. By placing an agent on the target servers and binding that to that server&#8217;s deployment environment, you can script the deployment steps as agent tasks.
</p>


<p>
  When consulting with your sysadmin team, the immediate temptation will probably be to use Puppet or Chef to perform the upgrades, as software configuration management. These didn&#8217;t work for us, however, as they work on the model of <em>eventual convergence</em>; i.e. that they&#8217;ll eventually get to the state that you desire, but not immediately. In a clustered system, however, you usually need events to happen in the correct order and be coordinated across hosts, e.g:
</p>


<ol>
  <li>Take server A out of the balancer pool</li>
  <li>Upgrade A</li>
  <li>Check A is operational</li>
  <li>Put A back into balancer pool</li>
  <li>Take B out of the balancer pool</li>
  <li>And so on&hellip;</li>
</ol>


<p>
  This is difficult to do with configuration management tools as you need something more directed; luckily a lot of work has been done in this area by the DevOps community over the last few years. Going into a full review of the options would be make this already too-long post longer, but suffice to say that we trialled a few options and eventually settled on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ansible.com/home">Ansible</a> for automation. The main deciding factor was that it has explicit support for a number of tools we already use including HipChat and Nagios (and look for <a target="_blank" href="http://docs.ansible.com/jira_module.html">JIRA support coming in 1.6</a>), and that it was explicitly designed to perform rolling upgrades across clusters of servers.
</p>


<p>
  Ansible uses YAML <a target="_blank" href="http://docs.ansible.com/playbooks.html">playbooks</a> to describe sequences of operations to perform across hosts. We maintain these in their own Git repository that we pull as a task in the deployment environment. In total, our deployment environment task list looks like:
</p>


<ul>
  <li>Download the build artifacts</li>
  <li>Fetch Ansible from git</li>
  <li>Fetch Ansible playbooks from git</li>
  <li>Run the necessary playbook</li>
</ul>


<p>
  However we use Puppet to the base-line configuration of the hosts, including the filesystem permissions and SSH keys that Ansible uses. Personally I&#8217;ve never understood the Puppet/Chef vs. Ansible/Salt/Rundeck dichotomy; I see them as entirely complementary. For example, I use Ansible to create clusters of AWS servers, place them in the DNS and behind load-balancers, and then bootstrap Puppet on the host to manage the OS-level configuration. Once that&#8217;s complete, Ansible is then used to manage the deployment and upgrade of the application-level software.</p>


<h2>Managing deployments</h2>


<p>
  So now you have your release being built and deployed to development, staging, QA, and production environments &ndash; but how do you know which versions of the software are deployed where? How do you arrange the promotion of QA/staging builds up to production? And how do you ensure only certain users can perform these promotions?
</p>


<p>
  Earlier spikes of the business-platform automated deployments relied on Bamboo&#8217;s child-plans to separate the build and deployment stages of the pipeline and allow setting of permissions. However, this was unwieldy, and it quickly became hard to track what was deployed where. But with the release of Bamboo 5 we rapidly replaced these with the new <a target="_blank" href="https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/BAMBOO/Deployment+projects">deployment environments</a>. These look a lot like standard build plans (and so can use the same task plugins available to the build jobs), but they support concepts necessary for effective deployments. In particular, they support the idea that a single build may be deployed to multiple locations (e.g. QA and staging), and then migrated onto other locations (e.g. production). They also have explicit integration with build plans but have their own permissions separate for the builds.
</p>


<p>
  There&#8217;s a lot to deployment environments, and going into their features would take too long. However I will note that, like the other stages of the build pipeline, deployment environments have their own integration and feedback points; most notably the original JIRA ticket can display when, for example, a feature has been deployed to the staging environment.
</p>


<h2>Procedural issues</h2>


<p>
  On the subject of management, there are some additional questions you may need to take into account. What these are will depend a lot on your organization, but I&#8217;ll cover a couple of the issues we had to address along the way:
</p>


<h3>Deployment security</h3>


<p>
  Most of our systems share a common Bamboo server with a massive array of build agents that is managed by a dedicated team. Our <em>open company, no bullshit</em> philosophy means that we extend a lot of trust internally, and assume all employees are acting in the best interests of the company. This means that we grant developers quite high privileges to create and administer their own build plans. However the company is growing, and the regulatory bodies ends to take a less stoic view of such things. In particular, the software we produce modifies the company financials, and so must have strict access controls associated with it.
</p>


<p>
  Although we investigated methods of remaining open but secure, in the end we decided that we should err on the side of strict compliance. To do this we identified all the systems that could be considered as falling under <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarbanes%E2%80%93Oxley_Act">SOX</a> scope and placed them into a separate build environment separated from the more liberal policies of the master Bamboo server.
</p>


<h3>Separation of duties</h3>


<p>
  Historically, the business platforms team has done a lot of our own operations. In some ways, we were doing DevOps before the idea came to wider recognition. However, SOX contains some strict rules about separation of duties; in particular the implementers of a software change must have oversight and cannot themselves sign-off on the deployment to production.
</p>


<p>
  Our solution to this was to hand off the deployment to production to the business analysts. The analysts are almost always involved in the triage and specification of software changes, and are therefore in a good position to judge the readiness of features etc. to be deployed. And the use of automated deployment, in particular Bamboo&#8217;s deployment environments, makes this role available to them rather than just sysadmins.
</p>


<p>
  In practice, we use the the deployment environment permission system to restrict production deployments to specific group (&ldquo;bizplat-releasers&rdquo;); we can then add and remove members as required.
</p>


<h2>Conclusion</h2>


<p>
  I&#8217;ve covered a lot here, and have only really scratched the surface of the practice of continuous deployment. But I hope this has helped to clarify some of the issues and solutions involved in adopting this powerful model into your organization.
</p>

<h3>￼Who Am I?</h3>

<h3>Balaji Vajjala!</h3>

<ul>
<li>A Full Stack DevOps Engineer/Solution Architect for 10+ years!</li>
<li>Original company sysadmin!</li>
<li>Developer for last 4 years!</li>
<li>Now working out of East Coast</li>
<li>Not a professional speaker</li>

<aside class='notes'>

<p>Hi, my name is Balaji Vajjala and I&rsquo;m the Chief Architect and DevOps Solution Architect.</p>

<p>I have been developing software in the financial and Telecom industry since Mid 90&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>I am always passionate about technology, and have delivered diverse project portfolios initially as a software developer and subsequently as a leader at various development organisations.</p>

<h3>￼￼What I’ve been up to&hellip;</h3>

<ul>
<li>Last 6 months converting our order systems to high-availability and continuous deployment.</li>
<li>Why 6 months?

<ul>
<li>Because the concept is straightforward, but it’s implications affect a lot of your organisation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>What is DevOps?</h3>

<ul>
<li>Continuous Deployment</li>
<li>Continuous Delivery</li>
<li>Continuous Integration</li>
</ul>


</div>

<aside class='notes'>

<p>I don&rsquo;t have to tell you guys about DevOps, but for our purposes the main point is that we can do more stuff using the DevOps principles and Deliver software in a Agile Fashion.</p>

<h3>￼￼“Deployment”? “Delivery”?</h3>

<ul>
<li>Continuous integration is continuous, automated build and test.!</li>
<li>Continuous delivery is the next obvious step; be continuously release-ready !</li>
<li>Continuous deployment is the final step, the continuous delivery of software to production.</li>
</ul>

<section class='slide'><div class='content'>

<p>￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼</p>

<h3>￼￼“Deployment”? “Delivery”?</h3>

<ul>
<li>Constant QA is the common theme.!</li>
<li>In practice there’s a continuous spectrum of options, each organisation has different needs and constraints.!</li>
<li>But if you trust your testing and process you can adopt the level appropriate for you.</li>
</ul>


</div>

<section class='slide'><div class='content'>

<p>￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼</p>

<h3>￼￼Why Continuous deployment?</h3>

<ul>
<li>We want to release features, not “what ever happens to be done”!</li>
<li>Automation: Releasing is hard, automation makes it repeatable!</li>
<li>Remove organisational bottlenecks to releases</li>
</ul>


</div>

</section>

<section class='slide'><div class='content'>

<p>￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼</p>

<h3>￼￼Why Continuous deployment? Stakeholder benefits</h3>

<ul>
<li>To customers: You’ll get your requested feature faster!!</li>
<li>To management: You’ll get results faster and clearer progress.!</li>
<li>To devs: No more death-marches, mad- dashes, clean-up after releases.!</li>
<li>To admins: You know which change broke the system!</li>
</ul>


</div>

</section>

<section class='slide'><div class='content'>

<p>￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼</p>

<h3>￼￼Continuous deployment: So how do you actually do it?</h3>

<ul>
<li>Continuous deployment guides tend to focus on the high-level philosophy!</li>
<li>But how do you actually get a feature from a customer request to your servers?</li>
</ul>


</div>

</section>

<section class='slide'><div class='content'>

<p>￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼</p>

<h3>￼￼Development workflow</h3>

<ul>
<li>Continuous deployment implies a clearer development process.!</li>
<li>You need to know what is going out when you release, not a dump of the current state.!</li>
<li>Hence release by feature</li>
</ul>


</div>

</section>

<section class='slide'><div class='content'>

<p>￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼</p>

<h3>￼￼Development</h3>

<ul>
<li>Track your feature requests in a bug tracker!</li>
<li>Branch on each feature, automatically test!</li>
<li>Pull requests for code-review/merge!</li>
<li>Automatic release to staging on each merge!</li>
<li>Promote from staging to production</li>
</ul>


</div>

</section>

<section class='slide'><div class='content'>

<p>￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼</p>

<h3>￼￼Step 1: Track your requests</h3>

<ul>
<li>Each feature/update request should have a unique ID.!</li>
<li>This allows tracking the state of a feature from request to deployment.!</li>
<li>Bug-trackers are a good choice for this.
￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼</li>
</ul>


</div>

</section>

<section class='slide'><div class='content'>

<p>￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼</p>

<h3>Step 2: Work on this feature in a branch</h3>

<ul>
<li>Create a branch for just this feature!</li>
<li>Name it after the feature request!</li>
<li>Jira/Stash integration will do this!</li>
<li>The branch will be merged when complete!</li>
<li>You need a sane version control system!</li>
<li>We use git, Mercurial is good too
￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼</li>
</ul>


</div>

</section>

<section class='slide'><div class='content'>

<p>￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼</p>

<h3>￼￼￼￼Step 3: Automatically test the branch</h3>

<ul>
<li>Run a continuous integration tool that will automatically run tests against the branch.!</li>
<li>Features may not be merged until all tests are passing.!</li>
<li>Stash has some features to support this.
￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼</li>
</ul>


</div>

</section>

<section class='slide'><div class='content'>

<p>￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼</p>

<h3>￼￼￼￼Step 4: Code review</h3>

<ul>
<li>No code may be merged to the release branch until reviewed by other members of the team.!</li>
<li>Team members have a responsibility to ensure quality.
￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼</li>
</ul>

<h3>￼￼￼￼Step 5: Merge and release</h3>

<ul>
<li>Once all reviews and tests are passed them merge to release branch!</li>
<li>At this point we have a separate Bamboo plan that performs a full release.
￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼</li>

<h3>￼￼￼￼Step 6: Deploy to staging</h3>

<ul>
<li>Allows testing of more advanced interactions and against production samples.!</li>
<li>More testing can occur at this point, including testing by humans.
￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼</li>

<h3>￼￼￼￼Step 7: Release to production</h3>

<ul>
<li>Valid staging builds may be promoted up to production.

<p>￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼</p>

<h3>￼￼￼￼Segue: “Continuous downtime”?</h3>

<ul>
<li>So if you’re doing all these releases, what about uptime?!</li>
<li>For public-facing service clustering/HA is important.!</li>
<li>Ideally you should be able to automate cluster configuration as part of the deployment
￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼</li>

  <div class="entry-content"><h1>What is jenkins job builder</h1>

<p>Jenkins job builder is extreme good tool to manage your jenkins CI jobs, it takes simple description from YAML files, and use them to configure jenkins.</p>

<pre><code>#set free style job
#job-template.yml
- job:
    name: testjob
    project-type: freestyle
    defaults: global
    disabled: false
    display-name: 'Fancy job name'
    concurrent: true
    quiet-period: 5
    workspace: /srv/build-area/job-name
    block-downstream: false
    block-upstream: false
</code></pre>

<p>Then put your jenkins access into jenkins.ini file</p>

<pre><code>[jenkins]
user=USERNAME
password=USER_TOKEN
url=JENKINS_URL
ignore_cache=IGNORE_CACHE_FLAG
</code></pre>

<p>Based on the job configuration above, you just need to type command</p>

<pre><code>$ jenkins-jobs --conf jenkins.ini update job-template.yaml 
</code></pre>

<p>Then your job <em>testjob</em> is created in your jenkins server.</p>

<p>The project is created by <a href="https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/InfraTeam">openstack-infrastructure team</a>, it is used to manage the openstack environment, fairly good.</p>

<h1>How it works</h1>

<p>There is no magic behind it, <em>jenkins-jobs</em> just convert the <em>job-template.yaml</em> to jenkins XML request file, and use jenkins remote API to send create request.</p>

<p>Try to do below to understand this.</p>

<pre><code>$ jenkins-jobs test job-template.yaml -o .
</code></pre>

<p>Then xml file <em>testjob</em> is created, see</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?xml version="1.0" ?&gt;
&lt;project&gt;
  &lt;actions/&gt;

</code></pre>

<p>Now you can use curl command to send the request (testjob) directly !!</p>

<pre><code>$ curl --user USER:PASS -H "Content-Type: text/xml" -s --data "@testjob" "http://jenkins-server/createItem?name=testjob"
</code></pre>

<h2>How to recreate your jenkins job</h2>

<p>Looks great, finally you need think about how to re-create your jenkins job, it is also simple, just download the config.xml</p>

<pre><code>$ curl --user USER:PASS http://jenkins-server/testjob/config.xml
</code></pre>

<p>Or open the configuration page in broswer *<a href="http://jenkins-server/testjob/configure*">http://jenkins-server/testjob/configure*</a> and map from YAML file.</p>

<p>You need to read <a href="http://ci.openstack.org/jenkins-job-builder/configuration.html">jenkins job builder&rsquo;s guideline</a> to know the map, generate it had level Macro like <a href="https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/InfraTeam">builders</a>, which is connected to the <a href="https://github.com/openstack-infra/jenkins-job-builder/blob/master/jenkins_jobs/modules/builders.py">real python builders module</a> to do transformation from YAML to XML.</p>

<p>What you stated in YAML file like</p>

<pre><code>-job:
  name: test_job
  builders:
- shell: "make test"
</code></pre>

<p>it will be converted to</p>

<pre><code>&lt;builders&gt;
&lt;hudson.tasks.Shell&gt;
  &lt;command&gt;make test&lt;/command&gt;&lt;/hudson.tasks.Shell&gt;
&lt;/builders&gt;
</code></pre>

<h2>How to extend</h2>

<p>Greatly to see jenkins job builder already had lots of default modules to support your normal jenkins jobs, but there is exceptions like some none popular jenkins plugins or your own plugins.</p>

<p>Then it is time to extend the module, the existing document: Extending is not clear enough, I will use example to show how it works, code is in <a href="https://github.com/bv2012/jenkins-buddy">github jenkins-buddy</a> project</p>

<p><a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/ArtifactDeployer+Plugin">ArtifactDeployer</a> Plugin is used as example, this plugin is the popular plugin to deploy the artifacts to other folder.</p>

<p>Artifact Deploy Plugin</p>

<p><img src="../downloads/code/artifactdeploy.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>And I want to have .YAML like below</p>

<pre><code>*#artifactdeploy.yaml*
- job:
name: test-job
publishers:
  - artifactdeployer: 
  includes: 'buddy-*.tar.gz'
  remote: '/project/buddy'
</code></pre>

<h2>write codes to transform</h2>

<p>Now I need to download the existing jobs to see how XML looks like, using curl above, I got it like</p>

<pre><code>&lt;publishers&gt;
   ...  
  &lt;org.jenkinsci.plugins.artifactdeployer.ArtifactDeployerPublisher plugin="artifactdeployer@0.27"&gt;
&lt;entries&gt;
  &lt;org.jenkinsci.plugins.artifactdeployer.ArtifactDeployerEntry&gt;
&lt;includes&gt;buddy-*.tar.gz&lt;/includes&gt;
&lt;basedir&gt;&lt;/basedir&gt;
&lt;excludes&gt;&lt;/excludes&gt;
&lt;remote&gt;/project/buddy&lt;/remote&gt;
&lt;flatten&gt;false&lt;/flatten&gt;
&lt;deleteRemote&gt;false&lt;/deleteRemote&gt;
&lt;deleteRemoteArtifacts&gt;false&lt;/deleteRemoteArtifacts&gt;
&lt;deleteRemoteArtifactsByScript&gt;false&lt;/deleteRemoteArtifactsByScript&gt;
&lt;failNoFilesDeploy&gt;false&lt;/failNoFilesDeploy&gt;
  &lt;/org.jenkinsci.plugins.artifactdeployer.ArtifactDeployerEntry&gt;
&lt;/entries&gt;
&lt;deployEvenBuildFail&gt;false&lt;/deployEvenBuildFail&gt;
  &lt;/org.jenkinsci.plugins.artifactdeployer.ArtifactDeployerPublisher&gt;
..
&lt;/publishers&gt; 
</code></pre>

<p>It belongs the section publishers So I write the jenkins_buddy/modules/publishers.py module to add one function artifactdeployer:</p>

<pre><code>def artifactdeployer(parser, xml_parent, data):
    logger = logging.getLogger("%s:artifactdeployer" % __name__)
    artifactdeployer = XML.SubElement(xml_parent, 'org.jenkinsci.plugins.artifactdeployer.ArtifactDeployerPublisher')
    entries = XML.SubElement(artifactdeployer, 'entries')
    entry = XML.SubElement(entries, 'org.jenkinsci.plugins.artifactdeployer.ArtifactDeployerEntry')
    print data
    XML.SubElement(entry, 'includes').text = data['includes']
    XML.SubElement(entry, 'remote').text = data['remote']
</code></pre>

<p>It is the core part handling convert.</p>

<h3>Hook into jenkins-job builder</h3>

<p>Now you need hook this script into jenkins-jobs builder, thank for the entry_points in python, it can be used for this.</p>

<p>Create the plugin related script and structure, add new entry_point in setup.py</p>

<pre><code>#setup.py in jenkins-buddy
entry_points={
    'jenkins_jobs.publishers': [
    'artifactdeployer=jenkins_buddy.modules.publishers:artifactdeployer',
    ],
}
</code></pre>

<p>it tells jenkins-jobs if you meet new keyword artifactdeployer in publishers, please let me jenkins_buddy.modules.publishers:artifactdeployer to handle.</p>

<h3>Verify it</h3>

<p>Build the pip package local and install it</p>

<pre><code>$ python setup.py sdist
$ pip install dist/jenkins-buddy-0.0.5.zip
</code></pre>

<p>And verify the new job, Bingo, it works.</p>

<pre><code>$ jenkins-jobs test artifactdeploy.yaml -o . 
</code></pre>

<h3>###Make it more complete by checking jenkins plugin java code</h3>

<p>Maybe you noticed, it is hack solution, since I skipped some parameter converting and guess what the XML will look like, if you want to make it more complete, we need to check the java codes directly.</p>

<p>src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/artifactdeployer/ArtifactDeployerPublisher.java is the class we need to take care.</p>

<pre><code>@DataBoundConstructor
public ArtifactDeployerPublisher(List&lt;ArtifactDeployerEntry&gt; deployedArtifact, boolean deployEvenBuildFail) {
    this.entries = deployedArtifact;
    this.deployEvenBuildFail = deployEvenBuildFail;
    if (this.entries == null)
    this.entries = Collections.emptyList();
}
</code></pre>

<p>It is directly mapping from XML into internal data, if you need know more, learn how to develop jenkins plugin.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h1>## Workflow : Deploying/Release Apps from Development to Production  ##</h1>

<p>Deploying is a big part of the lives of most of our Engineering employees. We don&rsquo;t have a release manager and there are no set weekly deploys. Developers and designers are responsible for shipping new stuff themselves as soon as it&rsquo;s ready. This means that deploying needs to be as smooth and safe a process as possible.</p>

<p>The best system we&rsquo;ve found so far to provide this flexibility is to have people deploy branches. Changes never get merged to master until they have been verified to work in production from a branch. This means that master is always stable; a safe point that we can roll back to if there&rsquo;s a problem.</p>

<p>The basic workflow goes like this:</p>

<ul>
<li>Push changes to a branch in GitHub</li>
<li>Wait for the build to pass on our CI server (Jenkins)</li>
<li>Tell Hubot to deploy it</li>
<li>Verify that the changes work and fix any problems that come up</li>
<li>Merge the branch into master
Not too long ago, however, this system wasn&rsquo;t very smart. A branch could accidentally be deployed before the build finished, or even if the build failed. Employees could mistakenly deploy over each other. As the company has grown, we&rsquo;ve needed to add some checks and balances to help us prevent these kinds of mistakes.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Safety First</h2>

<p>The first thing we do now, when someone tries to deploy, is make a call to <a href="https://github.com/github/janky">Janky</a> to determine whether the current CI build is green. If it hasn&rsquo;t finished yet or has failed, we&rsquo;ll tell the deployer to fix the situation and try again.</p>

<p>Next we check whether the application is currently &ldquo;locked&rdquo;. The lock indicates that a particular branch is being deployed in production and that no other deploys of the application should proceed for the moment. Successful builds on the master branch would otherwise get deployed automatically, so we don&rsquo;t want those going out while a branch is being tested. We also don&rsquo;t want another developer to accidentally deploy something while the branch is out.</p>

<p>The last step is to make sure that the branch we&rsquo;re deploying contains the latest commit on master that has made it into production. Once a commit on master has been deployed to production, it should never be “removed” from production by deploying a branch that doesn’t have that commit in it yet.</p>

<p>We use the GitHub API to verify this requirement. An endpoint on the github.com application exposes the SHA1 that is currently running in production. We submit this to the GitHub compare API to obtain the &ldquo;merge base&rdquo;, or the common ancestor, of master and the production SHA1. We can then compare this to the branch that we&rsquo;re attempting to deploy to check that the branch is caught up. By using the common ancestor of master and production, code that only exists on a branch can be removed from production, and changes that have landed on master but haven&rsquo;t been deployed yet won&rsquo;t require branches to merge them in before deploying.</p>

<p>If it turns out the branch is behind, master gets merged into it automatically. We do this using the new :sparkles:Merging API:sparkles: that we&rsquo;re making available today. This merge starts a new CI build like any other push-style event, which starts a deploy when it passes.</p>

<p>At this point the code actually gets deployed to our servers. We usually deploy to all servers for consistency, but a subset of servers can be specified if necessary. This subset can be by functional role — front-end, file server, worker, search, etc. — or we can specify an individual machine by name, e.g, &lsquo;fe7&rsquo;.</p>

<h2>Watch it in action</h2>

<p>What now? It depends on the situation, but as a rule of thumb, small to moderate changes should be observed running correctly in production for at least 15 minutes before they can be considered reasonably stable. During this time we monitor exceptions, performance, tweets, and do any extra verification that might be required. If non-critical tweaks need to be made, changes can be pushed to the branch and will be deployed automatically. In the event that something bad happens, rolling back to master only takes 30 seconds.</p>

<h2>All done!</h2>

<p>If everything goes well, it&rsquo;s time to merge the changes. At GitHub, we use Pull Requests for almost all of our development, so merging typically happens through the pull request page. We detect when the branch gets merged into master and unlock the application. The next deployer can now step up and ship something awesome.</p>

<h1>How do we do it?</h1>

<p>Most of the magic is handled by an internal deployment service called Heaven. At its core, Heaven is a catalog of Capistrano recipes wrapped up in a Sinatra application with a JSON API. Many of our applications are deployed using generic recipes, but more complicated apps can define their own to specify additional deployment steps. Wiring it up to Janky, along with clever use of post-receive hooks and the GitHub API, lets us hack on the niceties over time. Hubot is the central interface to both Janky and Heaven, giving everyone in Campfire great visibility into what’s happening all of the time. As of this writing, 75 individual applications are deployed by Heaven.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h2><a href="/blog/2013/03/22/designing-a-restful-api-that-doesn-t-suck.html">Designing A RESTful API That Doesn&rsquo;t Suck</a></h2>

<p>As we&rsquo;re getting closer to shipping the first version of <a href="http://devo.ps">devo.ps</a> and we are joined by a few new team members, the team took the time to review the few principles we followed when designing our RESTful JSON API. A lot of these can be found on <a href="https://blog.apigee.com/taglist/rest_api_design">apigee&rsquo;s blog</a> (a recommended read). Let me give you the gist of it:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Design your API for developers first</strong>, they are the main users. In that respect, simplicity and intuitivity matter.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol#Request_methods">HTTP verbs</a></strong> instead of relying on parameters (e.g. <code>?action=create</code>). HTTP verbs map nicely with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete">CRUD</a>:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>POST</code> for <em>create</em>,</li>
<li><code>GET</code> for <em>read</em>,</li>
<li><code>DELETE</code> for <em>remove</em>,</li>
<li><code>PUT</code> for <em>update</em> (and <code>PATCH</code> too).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes">HTTP status codes</a></strong>, especially for errors (authentication required, error on the server side, incorrect parameters)… There are plenty to choose from, here are a few:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>200</code>: <em>OK</em></li>
<li><code>201</code>: <em>Created</em></li>
<li><code>304</code>: <em>Not Modified</em></li>
<li><code>400</code>: <em>Bad Request</em></li>
<li><code>401</code>: <em>Unauthorized</em></li>
<li><code>403</code>: <em>Forbidden</em></li>
<li><code>404</code>: <em>Not Found</em></li>
<li><code>500</code>: <em>Internal Server Error</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Simple URLs for resources: first a noun for the collection, then the item</strong>. For example <code>/emails</code> and <code>/emails/1234</code>; the former gives you the collection of emails, the second one a specific one identified by its internal id.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Use verbs for special actions</strong>. For example, <code>/search?q=my+keywords</code>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Keep errors simple but verbose (and use HTTP codes)</strong>. We only send something like <code>{ message: "Something terribly wrong happened" }</code> with the proper status code (e.g. <code>401</code> if the call requires authentication) and log more verbose information (origin, error code…) in the backend for debugging and monitoring.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Relying on HTTP status codes and verbs should already help you keep your API calls and responses lean enough. Less crucial, but still useful:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>JSON first</strong>, then extend to other formats if needed and if time permits.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time">Unix time</a></strong>, or you&rsquo;ll have a bad time.</li>
<li><strong>Prepend your URLs with the API version</strong>, like <code>/v1/emails/1234</code>.</li>
<li><strong>Lowercase everywhere in URLs</strong>.</li>
</ul>

  <div class="entry-content"><h2><a href="/blog/2013/06/19/I-can-haz-init-script.html">I Can Haz Init Script</a></h2>

<p>Something went awfully wrong, and a rogue process is eating up all of the resources on one of your servers. You have no other choice but to restart it. No big deal, really; this is the age of disposable infrastructure after all. Except when it comes back up, everything starts going awry. Half the stuff supposed to be running is down and it&rsquo;s screwing with the rest of your setup.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/y-u-no-guy.png" alt="INIT SCRIPTS, Y U NO LIKE?" /></p>

<p>You don&rsquo;t get to think about them very often, but init scripts are a key piece of a sound, scalable strategy for your infrastructure. It&rsquo;s a <a href="">mandatory best practice</a>. Period. And there are quite a few things in the way of getting them to work properly at scale in production environments. It&rsquo;s a tough world out there.</p>

<h3>What we&rsquo;re dealing with…</h3>

<h4>Packages</h4>

<p>Often enough, you&rsquo;re gonna end up installing a service using the package manager of your distro: <code>yum</code>, <code>apt-get</code>, you name it. These packages usually come with an init script that should get you started.</p>

<p>Sadly, as your architecture grows in complexity, you&rsquo;ll probably run into some walls. Wanna have multiple memcache buckets, or several instances of redis running on the same box? You&rsquo;re out of luck buddy. Time to hack your way
through:</p>

<ul>
<li>Redefine your start logic,</li>
<li>Load one or multiple config files from <code>/etc/defaults</code> or <code>/etc/sysconfig</code>,</li>
<li>Deal with the PIDs, log and lock files,</li>
<li>Implement conditional logic to start/stop/restart one or more of the services,</li>
<li>Realize you&rsquo;ve messed something up,</li>
<li>Same player shoot again.</li>
</ul>


<p>Honestly: PITA.</p>

<h4>Built from source</h4>

<p>First things first: <strong>you shouldn&rsquo;t be building from source</strong> (unless you really, really need to).</p>

<p>Now if you do, you&rsquo;ll have to be thorough: there may be samples of init scripts in there, but you&rsquo;ll have to dig them out. <code>/contrib</code>, <code>/addons</code>, …it&rsquo;s never in the same place.</p>

<p>And that makes things &ldquo;fun&rdquo; when you&rsquo;re <a href="http://devo.ps/blog/2013/03/06/troubleshooting-5minutes-on-a-yet-unknown-box.html">trying to unscrew things on a box</a>:</p>

<ul>
<li>You figured out that MySQL is running from <code>/home/user/src/mysql</code>,</li>
<li>You check if there&rsquo;s an init script: no luck this time…</li>
<li>You try to understand what exactly launched <code>mysqld_safe</code>,</li>
<li>You spend a while digging into the bash history smiling at typos,</li>
<li>You stumble on a <code>run.sh</code> script (uncommented, of course) in the home directory. Funny enough, it seems to be starting everything from MySQL, NGINX and php-fpm to the coffee maker.</li>
<li>You make a mental note to try and track down the &ldquo;genius&rdquo; who did that mess of a job, and get busy with converting everything to a proper init script.</li>
</ul>


<p>Great.</p>

<h3>Why existing solutions suck</h3>

<p>Well, based on what we&rsquo;ve just seen, you really only have two options:</p>

<ol>
<li> <strong>DIY</strong>; but if you&rsquo;re good at what you do, you&rsquo;re probably also lazy. You may do it the first couple times, but that&rsquo;s not gonna scale, especially when dealing with the various flavors of init daemons (upstart, systemd…),</li>
<li> <strong>Use that thing called &ldquo;the Internet&rdquo;</strong>; you read through forum pages, issue queues, gists and if you&rsquo;re lucky you&rsquo;ll find a perfect one (or more likely 10 sucky ones). Kudos to all those of whom shared their work, but you&rsquo;ll probably be back to option 1.</li>
</ol>


<h3>We can do better than this</h3>

<p>You&rsquo;ll find a gazillion websites for pictures of kittens, but as far as I know, there is no authoritative source for init scripts. That&rsquo;s just not right: we have to fix it. A few things I&rsquo;m aiming for:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Scalable</strong>; allow for multiple instances of a service to be started at once from different config files (see the memcache/redis example),</li>
<li><strong>Secure</strong>; ensure <code>configtest</code> is run before a restart/reload (because, you know, a faulty config file preventing the service to restart is kind of a bummer),</li>
<li><strong>Smart</strong>; ensuring for example that the cache is aggressively flushed before restarting your database (so that you don&rsquo;t end-up waiting 50 min for the DB to cleanly shutdown).</li>
</ul>


<p><a href="https://github.com/devo-ps/init-scripts">I&rsquo;ve just created a repo</a> where I&rsquo;ll be dumping various init scripts that will hopefully be helpful to others. I&rsquo;d love to get suggestions or help.</p>

<p>And by the way, things are not much better with applications, though we&rsquo;re trying our best to improve things there too with things like <a href="https://github.com/Unitech/pm2">pm2</a> (fresh and shinny, more about it in a later post).</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s no secret that the devo.ps team has a crush on Javascript; node.js in the backend, AngularJS for our clients, there isn&rsquo;t much of our stack that isn&rsquo;t at least in part built with it. Our approach of building <a href="http://devo.ps/blog/2013/01/31/farewell-to-regular-web-development-approaches.html">static clients and RESTful JSON APIs</a> means that we run a lot of node.js and I must admit that, despite all of it awesomeness, node.js still is a bit of a
headache when it comes to running in production. Tooling and best practices (think monitoring, logging, error traces…) are still lacking when compared to some of the more established languages.</p>

<p>So far, we had been relying on the pretty nifty <a href="https://github.com/nodejitsu/forever">node-forever</a>. Great tool, but a few things were missing:</p>

<ul>
<li>Limited monitoring and logging abilities,</li>
<li>Poor support for process management configuration,</li>
<li>No support for clusterization,</li>
<li>Aging codebase (which meant frequent failures when upgrading Node).</li>
</ul>


<p>This is what led us to write <a href="https://github.com/Unitech/pm2">PM2</a> in the past couple months. We thought we&rsquo;d give you a quick look at it while we&rsquo;re nearing a production ready release.</p>

<h3>So what&rsquo;s in the box?</h3>

<p>First things first, you can install it with <code>npm</code>:</p>

<pre><code>npm install -g pm2
</code></pre>

<p>And now let me geek a tad more about the main features…</p>

<h3>Native clusterization</h3>

<p>Node v0.6 introduced the cluster feature, allowing you to share a socket across multiple networked Node applications. Problem is, it doesn&rsquo;t work out of the box and requires some tweaking to handle master and children processes.</p>

<p>PM2 handles this natively, without any extra code: PM2 itself will act as the master process and wrap your code into a special clustered process, as Nodejs does, to add some global variables to your files.</p>

<p>To start a clustered app using all the CPUs you just need to type something like that:</p>

<pre><code>$ pm2 start app.js -i max
</code></pre>

<p>Then;</p>

<pre><code>$ pm2 list
</code></pre>

<p>Which should display something like (ASCII UI FTW);</p>

<p><img src="http://apps.hemca.com/pm2/pres/pm2-list.png" alt="pm2 list" /></p>

<p>As you can see, your app is now forked into multiple processes depending on the number of CPUs available.</p>

<h3>Monitoring <em>a la</em> termcaps-HTOP</h3>

<p>It&rsquo;s nice enough to have an overview of the running processes and their status with the <code>pm2 list</code> command. But what about tracking their resources consumption? Fear not:</p>

<pre><code>$ pm2 monit
</code></pre>

<p>You should get the CPU usage and memory consumption by process (and cluster).</p>

<p><img src="http://apps.hemca.com/pm2/pres/pm2-monit.png" alt="pm2 monit" /></p>

<p><strong>Disclaimer</strong>: <a href="https://github.com/arunoda/node-usage">node-usage</a> doesn&rsquo;t support MacOS for now (feel free to PR). It works just fine on Linux though.</p>

<p>Now, what about checking on our clusters and GC cleaning of the memory stack?
Let&rsquo;s consider you already have an HTTP benchmark tool (if not, you should definitely check <a href="https://github.com/wg/wrk">WRK</a>):</p>

<pre><code>$ express bufallo     // Create an express app
$ cd bufallo
$ npm install
$ pm2 start app.js -i max
$ wrk -c 100 -d 100 http://localhost:3000/
</code></pre>

<p>In another terminal, launch the monitoring option:</p>

<pre><code>$ pm2 monit
</code></pre>

<p>W00t!</p>

<h3>Realtime log aggregation</h3>

<p>Now you have to manage multiple clustered processes: one who&rsquo;s crawling data, another who is processing stuff, and so on so forth. That means logs, lots of it. You can still handle it the old fashioned way:</p>

<pre><code>$ tail -f /path/to/log1 /path/to/log2 ...
</code></pre>

<p>But we&rsquo;re nice, so we wrote the <code>logs</code> feature:</p>

<pre><code>$ pm2 logs
</code></pre>

<p><img src="http://apps.hemca.com/pm2/pres/pm2-logs.png" alt="pm2 monit" /></p>

<h3>Resurrection</h3>

<p>So things are nice and dandy, your processes are humming and you need to do a hard restart. What now? Well, first, dump things:</p>

<pre><code>$ pm2 dump
</code></pre>

<p>From there, you should be able to resurrect things from file:</p>

<pre><code>$ pm2 kill     // let's simulate a pm2 stop
$ pm2 resurect // All my processes are now up and running 
</code></pre>

<h3>API Health point</h3>

<p>Let&rsquo;s say you want to monitor all the processes managed by PM2, as well as the status of the machine they run on (and maybe even build a nice Angular app to consume this API…):</p>

<pre><code>$ pm2 web
</code></pre>

<p>Point your browser at <code>http://localhost:9615</code>, aaaaand… done!</p>

<h3>And there&rsquo;s more…</h3>

<ul>
<li>Full tests,</li>
<li>Generation of <code>update-rc.d</code> (<code>pm2 startup</code>), though still very alpha,</li>
<li>Development mode with auto restart on file change (<code>pm2 dev</code>), still very drafty too,</li>
<li>Log flushing,</li>
<li>Management of your applications fleet via JSON file,</li>
<li>Log uncaught exceptions in error logs,</li>
<li>Log of restart count and time,</li>
<li>Automated killing of processes exiting too fast.</li>
</ul>


<h3>What&rsquo;s next?</h3>

<p>Well first, you could show your love on Github (we love stars):
<a href="https://github.com/Unitech/pm2">https://github.com/Unitech/pm2</a>.</p>

<p>We developed PM2 to offer an advanced and complete solution for Node process management. We&rsquo;re looking forward to getting more people helping us getting there: pull requests are more than welcome. A few things already on the
roadmap that we&rsquo;ll get right at once we have a stable core:</p>

<ul>
<li>Remote administration/status checking,</li>
<li>Built-in inter-processes communication channel (message bus),</li>
<li>V8 GC memory leak detection,</li>
<li>Web interface,</li>
<li>Persistent storage for monitoring data,</li>
<li>Email notifications.</li>
</ul>

  <div class="entry-content"><h2><a href="/blog/2013/07/03/ansible-simply-kicks-ass.html">Ansible Simply Kicks Ass</a></h2>

<p>The devo.ps team has been putting quite a few tools to the test over the years when it comes to managing infrastructures. We&rsquo;ve developed some ourselves and have adopted others. While the choice to use one over another is not always as clear-cut as we&rsquo;d like (I&rsquo;d love to rant about monitoring but will leave that for a later post), we&rsquo;ve definitely developed kind of a crush for <a href="https://github.com/ansible/ansible">Ansible</a> in the past 6 months. We went through years of using Puppet, then Chef and more recently Salt Stack, before Ansible gained unanimous adoption among our team.</p>

<p>What makes it awesome? Well, on top of my head:</p>

<ul>
<li>It&rsquo;s <strong>agent-less</strong> and works by default in <strong>push mode</strong> (that last point is subjective, I know).</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s <strong>easy to pick up</strong> (honestly, try and explain Chef or Puppet to a developer and see how long that takes you compared to Ansible).</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s <strong>just Python</strong>. It makes it easier for people like me to contribute (Ruby is not necessarily that mainstream among ops) and also means minimal dependency on install (Python is shipped by default with Linux).</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s <strong>picking up steam</strong> at an impressive pace (I believe we&rsquo;re at 10 to 15 pull requests a day).</li>
<li>And it has all of the good stuff: idempotence, roles, playbooks, tasks, handlers, lookups, callback plugins…</li>
</ul>


<p>Now, Ansible is still very much in its infancy and some technologies may not yet be supported. But there are a great deal of teams pushing hard on contributions, including us. In the past few weeks, for example, we&rsquo;ve
contributed both Digital Ocean and Linode modules. And we have a lot more coming, including some experimentations with Vagrant.</p>

<p>Now, an interesting aspect of Ansible, and one that makes it so simple, is that it comes by default with a tool-belt. Understand that it is shipped with a range of modules that add support for well known technologies: <a href="http://www.ansibleworks.com/docs/modules.html">EC2,
Rackspace, MySQL, PostgreSQL, rpm, apt,…</a>. This now includes our
Linode contribution. That means that with the latest version of Ansible you can spin off a new Linode box as easily as:</p>

<pre><code>ansible all -m linode -a "name='my-linode-box' plan=1 datacenter=2 distribution=99 password='p@ssword' "
</code></pre>

<p>Doing this with Chef would probably mean chasing down a knife plugin for adding Linode support, and would simply require a full Chef stack (say hello to RabbitMQ, Solr, CouchDB and a gazillion smaller dependencies). Getting
Ansible up and running is as easy as:</p>

<pre><code>pip install ansible
</code></pre>

<p>Et voila! You gotta appreciate the simple things in life. Especially the life of a sysadmin.</p>
