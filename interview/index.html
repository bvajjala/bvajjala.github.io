  <h1>What were your responsibilities at your current (or last) positions?</h1>

<h1>What was most / least rewarding?</h1>

<h1>What was your biggest accomplishment / failure in this position?</h1>

<h1>What major challenges and problems did you face? How did you handle them?</h1>

<h1>What were your starting and final levels of compensation?</h1>

<h1>Why are you leaving (did you leave) your job?</h1>

<h1>What applicable attributes / experience do you have?</h1>

<h1>What can you do for this company?</h1>

<h1>How do you evaluate success?</h1>

<ul>
<li>For me, success is about doing my job well. I want to be recognized as someone who always does their best and tries their hardest to make my goals.</li>
<li>I evaluate success based on not only my work, but the work of my team. In order for me to be considered successful, the team needs to achieve both our individual and our team goals.</li>
<li>I evaluate success based on outcomes. It&rsquo;s not always the path you take to achieve success that matters. Rather, it&rsquo;s quantifiable results.</li>
<li>To me, success is when I am performing well and satisfied with my position, knowing that my work is adding value to my company but also to my overall life and the lives of other people.&#8221;</li>
</ul>


<h1>What is your greatest weakness?</h1>

<ul>
<li>When I first started my current job my first few months were an uphill battle dealing with a backlog of work I inherited from my predecessor. I recognised that I have a weakness when it comes to time management. I have since been on a time management course, read a couple of books on the subject and I believe I’ve made a lot of progress. But it’s something I’m still very vigilant of. I make a concerted effort to apply the principles I’ve learned every day and to put in place procedures which enable me to most effectively prioritise and process my workload.</li>
</ul>


<h1>What is your greatest strength?</h1>

<ul>
<li>My time management skills are excellent and I&rsquo;m organized, efficient, and take pride in excelling at my work.</li>
</ul>


<h1>What do you expect from a manager?</h1>

<ul>
<li>I would like to be able to go my manager if I have an issue or idea and to be able to feel comfortable to expressing my thoughts. I would also expect my supervisor to be open and honest with me and to let me know if there is anything I could do to improve upon or do differently in my work.</li>
</ul>


<h1>What was it like working for your manager?</h1>

<ul>
<li>My Best Boss is one who is Honest, transparent and leads by example. Demonstrates the highest ethics and professionalism at work.</li>
</ul>


<h1>Who was your best manager and who was the worst?</h1>

<p>My best boss was a manager who enabled me to take on more responsibility as I progressed in my job. I&rsquo;ve had other bosses with a more hands off management style, but I appreciated the interaction with the first manager I mentioned.</p>

<p>My Worst Boss was a manager who was not a good communicator and very bad planner.</p>

<h1>Describe how you managed a problem employee.</h1>

<h1>If you knew a manager is 100% wrong about something how would you handle it?</h1>

<ul>
<li>It depends on the situation and the personality of the supervisor, one got to adapt according to the situation.</li>
</ul>


<p>One of my prior supervisors was new at his job and very soon i figured out that he didnot like his authority questioned. He&rsquo;s never bothered to learn the procedures, how things are done or how the computer system works. But if any of us tell him that how he wants something done won&rsquo;t work, he gets extremely angry. So, I never tell him he&rsquo;s wrong. Never. Whatever he tells me to do, I smile and say &ldquo;okay.&rdquo; Then if I know a way to get it done that will work, I do it that way, give him the results he wants and never tell him I didn&rsquo;t do it the way he told me to. He got the results and is happy.</p>

<h1>How do you handle stress and pressure?</h1>

<ul>
<li>I react to situations, rather than to stress. That way, the situation is handled and doesn&rsquo;t become stressful.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m the kind of person who stays calm under pressure, and handles stress fairly easily.</li>
</ul>


<h1>What motivates you?</h1>

<ul>
<li>I was responsible for several projects where I directed development teams and implemented repeatable processes. The teams achieved 100% on-time delivery of software products. I was motivated both by the challenge of finishing the projects ahead of schedule and by managing the teams that achieved our goals.</li>
</ul>


<h1>What do you find are the most difficult decisions to make?</h1>

<ul>
<li>At my previous engagement, Even though it was difficult when one of our Key Engineer quit without notice, we were able to rearrange the department workload to cover the position until a replacement was hired.</li>
</ul>


<h1>What do people most often criticize about you?</h1>

<h1>If the people who know you were asked why you should be hired, what would they say? Best Answers</h1>

<h1>Do you prefer to work independently or on a team?</h1>

<ul>
<li>I am equally comfortable working as a member of a team and independently. In researching your company, and the job description, I could see similarities to my previous position where there were some assignments that required a great deal of independent work and research and others where the team effort was most effective. As I said, I&rsquo;m comfortable with both.</li>
</ul>


<h1>Why should we hire you?</h1>

<h1>What can you contribute to this company?</h1>

<h1>Why are you the best person for the job?</h1>

<h1>What are your salary expectations?</h1>

<h1>What are you looking for in your next job? What is important to you?</h1>

<ul>
<li>I&rsquo;m looking for a position where I can have the opportunity to successfully use my skills. I want to be able to provide a company with the best possible work.</li>
</ul>


<h1>What are your goals for the next five years / ten years?</h1>

<ul>
<li>My long-term goals involve growing with a company where I can continue to learn, take on additional responsibilities, and contribute as much of value as I can.</li>
<li>I see myself as a top performing employee in a well-established organization, like this one. I plan on enhancing my skills and continuing my involvement in (related) professional associations.</li>
</ul>


<h1>How do you plan to achieve those goals?</h1>

<ul>
<li>I will continue my professional development my participating in conferences, attending seminars, and continuing my education.</li>
</ul>


<h1>Tell me about yourself.</h1>

<h1>How would you describe yourself as a amanger ?</h1>

<p>I’m a very hands-on manager. Whilst I am clearly in charge of my team, we are nonetheless a team – and I am very much a member of that team. When the circumstances require it, I will assert my authority and lead my staff in the direction I have determined we should go. However, I’m always open to input, ideas and suggestions and consider myself to be very approachable in that respect. I realise the importance of motivating my staff to deliver their best and I’m tactful and diplomatic when dealing with potential problems; I believe a lot more can be achieved through communication than through conflict. I am nevertheless very results-driven and expect every member of my team to pull their weight and help us to achieve our common goals.</p>

<h1>Do you mind if we contact your current employer for a reference?</h1>

<ul>
<li>I understand the importance of references and would be de-lighted for you to have a word with my referees – I’m confi-dent they’ll be very supportive of my application. However, be-cause my decision to change jobs is quite a sensitive issue – par-ticularly with regard to my current employer – I would of course prefer it if we could leave the issue of referees until such time as we might be discussing a firm job offer.</li>
</ul>


<h1>Questions to ask?</h1>

<ul>
<li>What are the top priorities for my first six months in the job?</li>
<li>How would you describe the team i will be working with?</li>
<li>How do you see my role evolving over the next two to three years?</li>
<li>How do you see the Organisation evolving over the next five years</li>
<li>What training and professional development opportunities will be avilable?</li>
</ul>
