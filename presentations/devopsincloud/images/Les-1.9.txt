You can see it's a part of the build history and as it's going ifYou can see every step that it's going through this part of the bill process so you can include in this case is just the application goes Grandeza file but you can do the same with deployment you can do the same with the end for structure it's all part of this and then you can link it together as a part of delivery pipeline will go and that next lessonOr what's called a delivery pipelineIn the context of Jenkins a pipeline is a process in which different types of jobs are run based on the success of the previous JottI'm using a plug-in from Jenkins called the bill pipeline in the delivery pipeline I configured various stages going to commit stage acceptance agents on so the idea with each of these stages is that it builds on the success of the previous stage which means that throughout this pipeline it reduces the overall risk of the release candidate which it was each successive stage so in this stage in the commit stage you're going to be running very quick building test when you going to the acceptance stage even going to be doing things like building an apartment creating a database writing except insteadActivities are going to take much longer and also that are going to assess the overall risk so you're going to reduce risk as you go through each of these subsequent stages this take a look at how we might do this within Jenkins as part of his build pipeline plug-in that allows you to create this overall delivery pipelineSo the first thing we're to do is just do some set of activities we're going to go to the SUS tab and ask US is this temple Q service that's a part of Amazon web services and when I create a couple of cues these cues are to be used by the delivery pipeline so the first Q I'm going to create is called cloud formation stacksThis is a one-time activity so I will go toSQLCradinew to banana confirmation stacks for the default visibility timeout just zeroAnd click create toThem when I create a Q called appointmentGo back to the SGS tabSelect create new queueAnd the same default visibility timeoutNow that we have a basic set up were going to go to the Jenkins dashboard we're going to select the CD pipelineYou can see here it's going toTwo different jobs is going around the target environment job is going to run a Diplaina job now the bill job we just went over in the bill job that she creates thatZip file and in that zip file gets pushed to the simple sorceress to S3And as a part of this process what happens is you create a target environment secretes in varmint using confirmation that it that the software will be deployed toAnd then it uses the build artifact that you create is part of the build job and it deploys it using this Diplaina job it deploys it onto the target environments associates three steps one is billedWhere traits zip distributionAnd then it creates the environment and then a deploys to me and Barnich are you createdThis take a look at how we set that upSo if you going to say target environmentAnd you select configureYou can see here in the postal actions we have a dependency that we set up where we build other projects soIt runs the deployment jobSo as I discuss before the bill job will create the artifact is going to be made available S3 then securely it's goingLet's go back to the pipelineAnd select start the build the pipeline see that she set this up in such a way where with every single change Agosta this process or you can do it because I'm doing here's a man just like SartinvilleSo we're going to go to S3Just to verifyThe names the buckets that we created remember from before a true couple buckets one was to host my priorities and business cases go DITC PMD cretins some going to use the name of this bucketAnd entered into as part of the delivery pipeline them know you still Genelabs if you call the instructions in previous lessons usually something like DITC XYZ artifacts XYZ for yourAnd as we discussed before anything globally addressable I'm two years has to be different thanSo for sloganize DITC PMD for the private credentialsThis will take someone depends and attendance issues and but by default we're using a and one medium instance is going take on new order 15 to 20 minutes to both of this delivery pipeline
