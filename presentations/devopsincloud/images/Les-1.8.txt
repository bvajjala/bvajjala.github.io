One for environment creation one prevailed another court-appointedIn Jenkins is pulling this get repository and I will discover changes when he discovers these changes is going to run jobIn the case of where going over to find a chance and change the application code Misurata job to build the softwareAnd it also discovers he changes to it for shocker scripts are in the database in any part of that overall delivery systemSo the first thing we're going to do is Cranenest three buckets going to host the SSH keys that we created beforeSo Wokalek PS3 tab and will select create bucketAnd call whenever you wantBut in this case it does need to be globally addressableSo this Gazel called DITC PMD CreadI'll need to take note of that when I watch the stack laterTonight to upload the SSH keys into the S3 bucket Sarunas it's your copy these as it's HD files from our AWS CLI instance onto her computerSenescu for sending that you're using some kind next base computer but you're if you are using Windows friends and you can use to call putting it is missing somethingSo one note here is that this easy to incenses public DNS it's easier to be different for you but this is the syntax interviewsMail should be the same except for maybe your localDirectory and as good as I'm using desktop someone to copy thisAnd I'm in my directory where my private KiiasSo PasettaAnd with this is going to do is to runOur Jenkins and Cincinnati connection pole from get Hobsons can use these keys are on the instance in order to get changes from getTo know to go into the S3 bucketAnd going to upload these three filesSo we go to the EstratabWill select the bucket we just createdClick uploadSlickback filesWill go to the desktop which is where I downloaded to I'll selectThe three files that I just got from AWS TLIAnd then I'll selectStart uploadSo now all three of these files are in Astrea bucketAnd by default all these are privately accessible soOnly if you have the root account or you have the proper permissions will you have access to only if you intentionally make it public will be available later on when we get to the next size of washing Hansons are confirmations going to create what's called an IM userTo get access to these three filesAnd now we're going to launch a Jenkinson since using confirmationTo you going to click on the linkAnd you see that the total URLs providedTo continueIn this caseI will be putting thenMy credentials wishesThis is the S3 bucket and we created before you undervalue for what's called the public bucket field which actually is in public by the way with the name of the bucket did you Creedon lesson 11 minus called Stilton labs reviews example lesson 11 euros will be something like DITC XYZ artifex XYZ for your initialsIn the keyname is what we created earlier on the DITC.com file that's a predicate to getIn the instance type is a C-1 medium insensible be using and then you will selectThat you Kalissa the temple will be creating I am resources identity and access managementCould continueTo get continued just like before and then you close it outAnd you can see that the status is great progressIt'll take someone order of 10 to 15 minutesTo create this Jenkinson sense install the servers on it and run through the template that a similar template to what we saw before silicic a look at the confirmation site now that we've lost it when I check the statusSo we'll bring up the confirmation tab and you can see here that the sackWhich is the Jenkins stack is now Achray complete so we can select right next to the check box right next to the sack and we go to the outputs tab and we click on it's Ashley provides is a fullyQualified URL that we can click on and that's actual was all created as part of the Jenkins template file which is that confirmation temple that we talked about briefly a little bit before so I can click onThe URL antenna launch it fully functioning Jenkins continues integration server gelastic a look at the build the bills are Iran overlooking the details little bit
Running beltSome going to click on configure linkWill take a look at this so you can see here in the source code management is usingThe get repositories weAnd it's polling on admit my minute basis is going to check the get have the location of get we also have it holy so in this case this is using CronThat runs the overall he runs the test so when it runs or speck spec it runs the test and then at the end it tars it all up into a zip file and makes it available for the plumbing processSo were going to click build nowYou can see it's a part of the build history and as it's going if
