As a part of overall delivery pipeline we are going to run some automated tests. 
we are going to make some very simple changes and commit it into Github.

to ensure that infra is always in the expected state.
tools like cucumber is also referred to as behaviour driven development which we will cover lot more detail later.
So we're going to go to the Amazon Web services CLI the command line interface
And we're going to start walking through the steps

So in going to this EC2 instance

We're going to use this command here working I just change the directory you were to get into a lot more detail how to use this later
And then we're going to open up the file, Which is a ruby script is written in cucumber and we are going to make a very simple change 
Where going to modify
The description of this 
Save the changes
Going to go back to the root directory of the sample app
ANd going to add the changes via the github
And to commit the file
This is going to go to the github master
