				    <h3>Orchestration and Deployment Pipeline Visualization</h3>
				    <p>
				      Orchestration tools are the backbone of any CD system. 
				      They allow teams to build an effective sequence of deployment pipeline steps by integrating with their entire toolchain. These tools can also provide visualization utilities, which are important for enabling the full involvement of stakeholders from all departments. 

				      For pipeline orchestration and visualization, you can use a dedicated deployment pipeline tool or you can use an application release automation (ARA) solution. 
				    Whichever direction you take for your orchestration tool, you should be sure that it helps your team detect and expose delays at each stage of the pipeline, including wait times between stages. 
				    Visualization and orchestration working in tandem allow teams to quickly identify the places they should optimize first.

				    ## Version Control
				    
				      Most software development teams use a version control system for the 
				      files they consider source code. however, many organizations forget to 
				      include configuration files, such as the configuration that defines the 
				      build and release system. All text-based assetsshould be stored in a version control system 
				      that everyone can easily access. The code changes should be very easy to review, 
				      line-by-line (ideally in a web browser), with a pull or merge request.

				    ## Continuous Integration
						CI tools can support orchestration and visualization, but their core functionality is 
						to integrate new code with the stable main release line and alert stakeholders 
						if any new code would cause issues with the final product. This makes it easy for 
						teams to combine work on different features while keeping a master code branch ready for release. 
						It should feel natural to integrate many times a day. Teams should also connect a code metrics 
						and profiling utility that can stop integrations if certain metrics reach an undesirable threshold.

				    ## Artifact Management

				    Packaged artifacts, rather than the application’s raw source code, are the focus of 
				    deployment pipelines. Artifacts are assembled pieces of an application that include 
				    packaged application code, application assets, infrastructure code, virtual machine 
				    images, and (typically) configuration data. 

				    Artifacts are identifiable (unique name), versioned (preferably semantic versioning), 
				    and immutable (we never edit them). Together, these artifacts allow developers to 
				    build a bill of materials (BOM) package describing the exact versions of all the artifacts 
				    in a particular version of their software system. Package metadata identifies 
				    when and how the package was tested or deployed into a particular environment. 

				    Artifact management is most effective with an artifact repository manager. 
				    Artifact repositories contain a complete artifact usage history, similar to the 
				    way version control systems track source code changes. They use dependency resolution 
				    between the package versions and allow the system to build a dependency graph from the hardware 
				    all the way up to the user interface of the application. The ability to verify dependencies 
				    through an entire system is powerful for tracking exactly what was (or will be) tested or deployed.

				    ## Test and Environment Automation
				    The only manual testing in a deployment pipeline should be for tests that are tough for a 
				    computer to handle, such as exploratory testing, inspection of user interface designs, 
				    and user acceptance tests. The rest should be automated. 

				    Tools for automated testing should operate in a completely headless (non-interactive) manner 
				    and be lightweight enough to run across many test servers simultaneously. 

				    Teams also need to create testing environments on-demand by using environment automation tools 
				    that can provision a VM and configure an environment template.

				    ## Server Configuration and Deployment

					Current deployment tools support three models:
					Push model: Manages the distribution and installation of packages to 
								multiple remote machines. It’s a good choice for smaller systems 
								because its usually simple and quick.

					Pull model: Requires an infrastructure configuration tool such as Chef or Puppet.  
								Supporters say it scales better than push and like that it treats the 
								deployment of application code as another step in configuring the infrastructure.

					Hybrid model: Uses a push tool to trigger a pull client on target servers.  
								  For any of the three models, your team must ensure that the process is fully automated, 
								  provides detailed information with standard output and error messages, 
								  and allows easy and rapid rollback to a stable state.

				    ## Monitoring and Reporting
					Monitoring your system logs is essential for spotting problems and halting 
					the deployment pipeline. Rather than manually collecting logs from each machine 
					in an environment, logs should be shipped to a central store that indexes them and makes 
					them available for searching via a web browser. This is a crucial capability 
					for a Continuous Delivery environment. The log store should be connected to all 
					environments (including the developers system) to speed up problem diagnosis and 
				    resolution. Most monitoring tools should work in a dynamic infrastructure and integrate 
				    with yours through scripted configuration.
