<p>Something went awfully wrong, and a rogue process is eating up all of the resources on one of your servers. You have no other choice but to restart it. No big deal, really; this is the age of disposable infrastructure after all. Except when it comes back up, everything starts going awry. Half the stuff supposed to be running is down and it&rsquo;s screwing with the rest of your setup.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/y-u-no-guy.png" alt="INIT SCRIPTS, Y U NO LIKE?" /></p>

<p>You don&rsquo;t get to think about them very often, but init scripts are a key piece of a sound, scalable strategy for your infrastructure. It&rsquo;s a <a href="">mandatory best practice</a>. Period. And there are quite a few things in the way of getting them to work properly at scale in production environments. It&rsquo;s a tough world out there.</p>

<h3>What we&rsquo;re dealing with…</h3>

<h4>Packages</h4>

<p>Often enough, you&rsquo;re gonna end up installing a service using the package manager of your distro: <code>yum</code>, <code>apt-get</code>, you name it. These packages usually come with an init script that should get you started.</p>

<p>Sadly, as your architecture grows in complexity, you&rsquo;ll probably run into some walls. Wanna have multiple memcache buckets, or several instances of redis running on the same box? You&rsquo;re out of luck buddy. Time to hack your way
through:</p>

<ul>
<li>Redefine your start logic,</li>
<li>Load one or multiple config files from <code>/etc/defaults</code> or <code>/etc/sysconfig</code>,</li>
<li>Deal with the PIDs, log and lock files,</li>
<li>Implement conditional logic to start/stop/restart one or more of the services,</li>
<li>Realize you&rsquo;ve messed something up,</li>
<li>Same player shoot again.</li>
</ul>


<p>Honestly: PITA.</p>

<h4>Built from source</h4>

<p>First things first: <strong>you shouldn&rsquo;t be building from source</strong> (unless you really, really need to).</p>

<p>Now if you do, you&rsquo;ll have to be thorough: there may be samples of init scripts in there, but you&rsquo;ll have to dig them out. <code>/contrib</code>, <code>/addons</code>, …it&rsquo;s never in the same place.</p>

<p>And that makes things &ldquo;fun&rdquo; when you&rsquo;re <a href="http://devo.ps/blog/2013/03/06/troubleshooting-5minutes-on-a-yet-unknown-box.html">trying to unscrew things on a box</a>:</p>

<ul>
<li>You figured out that MySQL is running from <code>/home/user/src/mysql</code>,</li>
<li>You check if there&rsquo;s an init script: no luck this time…</li>
<li>You try to understand what exactly launched <code>mysqld_safe</code>,</li>
<li>You spend a while digging into the bash history smiling at typos,</li>
<li>You stumble on a <code>run.sh</code> script (uncommented, of course) in the home directory. Funny enough, it seems to be starting everything from MySQL, NGINX and php-fpm to the coffee maker.</li>
<li>You make a mental note to try and track down the &ldquo;genius&rdquo; who did that mess of a job, and get busy with converting everything to a proper init script.</li>
</ul>


<p>Great.</p>

<h3>Why existing solutions suck</h3>

<p>Well, based on what we&rsquo;ve just seen, you really only have two options:</p>

<ol>
<li> <strong>DIY</strong>; but if you&rsquo;re good at what you do, you&rsquo;re probably also lazy. You may do it the first couple times, but that&rsquo;s not gonna scale, especially when dealing with the various flavors of init daemons (upstart, systemd…),</li>
<li> <strong>Use that thing called &ldquo;the Internet&rdquo;</strong>; you read through forum pages, issue queues, gists and if you&rsquo;re lucky you&rsquo;ll find a perfect one (or more likely 10 sucky ones). Kudos to all those of whom shared their work, but you&rsquo;ll probably be back to option 1.</li>
</ol>


<h3>We can do better than this</h3>

<p>You&rsquo;ll find a gazillion websites for pictures of kittens, but as far as I know, there is no authoritative source for init scripts. That&rsquo;s just not right: we have to fix it. A few things I&rsquo;m aiming for:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Scalable</strong>; allow for multiple instances of a service to be started at once from different config files (see the memcache/redis example),</li>
<li><strong>Secure</strong>; ensure <code>configtest</code> is run before a restart/reload (because, you know, a faulty config file preventing the service to restart is kind of a bummer),</li>
<li><strong>Smart</strong>; ensuring for example that the cache is aggressively flushed before restarting your database (so that you don&rsquo;t end-up waiting 50 min for the DB to cleanly shutdown).</li>
</ul>


<p><a href="https://github.com/devo-ps/init-scripts">I&rsquo;ve just created a repo</a> where I&rsquo;ll be dumping various init scripts that will hopefully be helpful to others. I&rsquo;d love to get suggestions or help.</p>

<p>And by the way, things are not much better with applications, though we&rsquo;re trying our best to improve things there too with things like <a href="https://github.com/Unitech/pm2">pm2</a> (fresh and shinny, more about it in a later post).</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2><a href="/blog/2013/03/06/troubleshooting-5minutes-on-a-yet-unknown-box.html">First 5 Minutes Troubleshooting A Server</a></h2>

<p>Back when our team was dealing with operations, optimization and scalability at <a href="http://wiredcraft.com">our previous company</a>, we had our fair share of troubleshooting poorly performing applications and infrastructures of various sizes, often large (think CNN or the World Bank). Tight deadlines, &ldquo;exotic&rdquo; technical stacks and lack of information usually made for memorable experiences.</p>

<p>The cause of the issues was rarely obvious: here are a few things we usually got started with.</p>

<h3>Get some context</h3>

<p>Don&rsquo;t rush on the servers just yet, you need to figure out how much is already known about the server and the specifics of the issues. You don&rsquo;t want to waste your time (trouble) shooting in the dark.</p>

<p>A few &ldquo;must have&rdquo;:</p>

<ul>
<li>What exactly are the symptoms of the issue? Unresponsiveness? Errors?</li>
<li>When did the problem start being noticed?</li>
<li>Is it reproducible?</li>
<li>Any pattern (e.g. happens every hour)?</li>
<li>What were the latest changes on the platform (code, servers, stack)?</li>
<li>Does it affect a specific user segment (logged in, logged out, geographically located…)?</li>
<li>Is there any documentation for the architecture (physical and logical)?</li>
<li><strong>Is there a monitoring platform?</strong> Munin, Zabbix, Nagios, <a href="http://newrelic.com/">New Relic</a>… Anything will do.</li>
<li><strong>Any (centralized) logs?</strong>. Loggly, Airbrake, Graylog…</li>
</ul>


<p>The last two ones are the most convenient sources of information, but don&rsquo;t expect too much: they&rsquo;re also the ones usually painfully absent. Tough luck, make a note to get this corrected and move on.</p>

<h3>Who&rsquo;s there?</h3>

<pre><code>$ w
$ last
</code></pre>

<p>Not critical, but you&rsquo;d rather not be troubleshooting a platform others are playing with. One cook in the kitchen is enough.</p>

<h3>What was previously done?</h3>

<pre><code>$ history
</code></pre>

<p>Always a good thing to look at; combined with the knowledge of who was on the box earlier on. Be responsible by all means, being admin shouldn&rsquo;t allow you to break ones privacy.</p>

<p>A quick mental note for later, you may want to update the environment variable <code>HISTTIMEFORMAT</code> to keep track of the time those commands were ran. Nothing is more frustrating than investigating an outdated list of commands…</p>

<h3>What is running?</h3>

<pre><code>$ pstree -a
$ ps aux
</code></pre>

<p>While <code>ps aux</code> tends to be pretty verbose, <code>pstree -a</code> gives you a nice condensed view of what is running and who called what.</p>

<h3>Listening services</h3>

<pre><code>$ netstat -ntlp
$ netstat -nulp
$ netstat -nxlp
</code></pre>

<p>I tend to prefer running them separately, mainly because I don&rsquo;t like looking at all the services at the same time. <code>netstat -nalp</code> will do to though. Even then, I&rsquo;d ommit the <code>numeric</code> option (IPs are more readable IMHO).</p>

<p>Identify the running services and whether they&rsquo;re expected to be running or not. Look for the various listening ports. You can always match the PID of the process with the output of <code>ps aux</code>; this can be quite useful especially when you end up with 2 or 3 Java or Erlang processes running concurrently.</p>

<p>We usual prefer to have more or less specialized boxes, with a low number of services running on each one of them. If you see 3 dozens of listening ports you probably should make a mental note of investigating this further and see
what can be cleaned up or reorganized.</p>

<h3>CPU and RAM</h3>

<pre><code>$ free -m
$ uptime
$ top
$ htop
</code></pre>

<p>This should answer a few questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Any free RAM? Is it swapping?</li>
<li>Is there still some CPU left? How many CPU cores are available on the server? Is one of them overloaded?</li>
<li>What is causing the most load on the box? What is the load average?</li>
</ul>


<h3>Hardware</h3>

<pre><code>$ lspci
$ dmidecode
$ ethtool
</code></pre>

<p>There are still a lot of bare-metal servers out there, this should help with;</p>

<ul>
<li>Identifying the RAID card (with BBU?), the CPU, the available memory slots. This may give you some hints on potential issues and/or performance improvements.</li>
<li>Is your NIC properly set? Are you running in half-duplex? In 10MBps? Any TX/RX errors?</li>
</ul>


<h3>IO Performances</h3>

<pre><code>$ iostat -kx 2
$ vmstat 2 10
$ mpstat 2 10
$ dstat --top-io --top-bio
</code></pre>

<p>Very useful commands to analyze the overall performances of your backend;</p>

<ul>
<li>Checking the disk usage: has the box a filesystem/disk with 100% disk usage?</li>
<li>Is the swap currently in use (si/so)?</li>
<li>What is using the CPU: system? User? Stolen (VM)?</li>
<li><code>dstat</code> is my all-time favorite. What is using the IO? Is MySQL sucking up the resources? Is it your PHP processes?</li>
</ul>


<h3>Mount points and filesystems</h3>

<pre><code>$ mount
$ cat /etc/fstab
$ vgs
$ pvs
$ lvs
$ df -h
$ lsof +D / /* beware not to kill your box */
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>How many filesystems are mounted?</li>
<li>Is there a dedicated filesystem for some of the services? (MySQL by any chance..?)</li>
<li>What are the filesystem mount options: noatime? default? Have some filesystem been re-mounted as read-only?</li>
<li>Do you have any disk space left?</li>
<li>Is there any big (deleted) files that haven&rsquo;t been flushed yet?</li>
<li>Do you have room to extend a partition if disk space is an issue?</li>
</ul>


<h3>Kernel, interrupts and network usage</h3>

<pre><code>$ sysctl -a | grep ...
$ cat /proc/interrupts
$ cat /proc/net/ip_conntrack /* may take some time on busy servers */
$ netstat
$ ss -s
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>Are your IRQ properly balanced across the CPU? Or is one of the core overloaded because of network interrupts, raid card, …?</li>
<li>How much is swappinness set to? 60 is good enough for workstations, but when it come to servers this is generally a bad idea: you do not want your server to swap… ever. Otherwise your swapping process will be locked while data is read/written to the disk.</li>
<li>Is <code>conntrack_max</code> set to a high enough number to handle your traffic?</li>
<li>How long do you maintain TCP connections in the various states (<code>TIME_WAIT</code>, …)?</li>
<li><code>netstat</code> can be a bit slow to display all the existing connections, you may want to use <code>ss</code> instead to get a summary.</li>
</ul>


<p>Have a look at <a href="http://www.lognormal.com/blog/2012/09/27/linux-tcpip-tuning/">Linux TCP tuning</a> for some more pointer as to how to tune your network stack.</p>

<h3>System logs and kernel messages</h3>

<pre><code>$ dmesg
$ less /var/log/messages
$ less /var/log/secure
$ less /var/log/auth
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>Look for any error or warning messages; is it spitting issues about the number of connections in your conntrack being too high?</li>
<li>Do you see any hardware error, or filesystem error?</li>
<li>Can you correlate the time from those events with the information provided beforehand?</li>
</ul>


<h3>Cronjobs</h3>

<pre><code>$ ls /etc/cron* + cat
$ for user in $(cat /etc/passwd | cut -f1 -d:); do crontab -l -u $user; done
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>Is there any cron job that is running too often?</li>
<li>Is there some user&rsquo;s cron that is &ldquo;hidden&rdquo; to the common eyes?</li>
<li>Was there a backup of some sort running at the time of the issue?</li>
</ul>


<h3>Application logs</h3>

<p>There is a lot to analyze here, but it&rsquo;s unlikely you&rsquo;ll have time to be exhaustive at first. Focus on the obvious ones, for example in the case of a LAMP stack:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Apache &amp; Nginx</strong>; chase down access and error logs, look for <code>5xx</code> errors, look for possible <code>limit_zone</code> errors.</li>
<li><strong>MySQL</strong>; look for errors in the <code>mysql.log</code>, trace of corrupted tables, innodb repair process in progress. Looks for slow logs and define if there is disk/index/query issues.</li>
<li><strong>PHP-FPM</strong>; if you have php-slow logs on, dig in and try to find errors (php, mysql, memcache, …). If not, set it on.</li>
<li><strong>Varnish</strong>; in <code>varnishlog</code> and <code>varnishstat</code>, check your hit/miss ratio. Are you missing some rules in your config that let end-users hit your backend instead?</li>
<li><strong>HA-Proxy</strong>; what is your backend status? Are your health-checks successful? Do you hit your max queue size on the frontend or your backends?</li>
</ul>


<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>After these first 5 minutes (give or take 10 minutes) you should have a better
understanding of:</p>

<ul>
<li>What is running.</li>
<li>Whether the issue seems to be related to IO/hardware/networking or configuration (bad code, kernel tuning, …).</li>
<li>Whether there&rsquo;s a pattern you recognize: for example a bad use of the DB indexes, or too many apache workers.</li>
</ul>


<p>You may even have found the actual root cause. If not, you should be in a good place to start digging further, with the knowledge that you&rsquo;ve covered the obvious.</p>
