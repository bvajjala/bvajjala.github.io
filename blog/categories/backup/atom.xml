    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="left" src="/assets/images/subversion.jpg" title="&lsquo;Subversion Logo&rsquo;" >An important notice to users of the hot-backup.py utility which ships with subversion.</p>

<p>I found our nightly backup of subversion was failing with the following error:</p>

<pre><code>svnadmin: Can't open file '/pathtorepo/db/fsfs.conf': No such file or directory
</code></pre>

<p>What was troubling me was:</p>

<ol>
<li>How come a file is missing in my svn repository &ndash; nothing has changes (As far as I know &hellip; :)</li>
<li>hot-backup.py script hasen&rsquo;t changed much, how come my version has changed ?</li>
</ol>


<p>So I looked up the subversion&rsquo;s change log: <a href="http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/subversion/tags/1.6.12/CHANGES">http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/subversion/tags/1.6.12/CHANGES</a> which is the latest release (1.6.12) and took a look on my svn machine to find which version was installed and I found 1.6.12 was indeed in talled and in 1.6.11 release notes you will find:</p>

<pre><code>* make 'svnadmin hotcopy' copy the fsfs config file (r905303)
</code></pre>

<p>In addition I took a look at hot-bakup.py change log under: <a href="http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/subversion/trunk/tools/backup/hot-backup.py.in?view=log,">http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/subversion/trunk/tools/backup/hot-backup.py.in?view=log,</a> and found that indeed the fsfs file has be included in the hotbackup script since the 1.6.11 version of the file (see link speified above).</p>

<p>Googeling on the fsfs.conf subject led me to: <a href="http://comments.gmane.org/gmane.comp.version-control.subversion.user/97647">http://comments.gmane.org/gmane.comp.version-control.subversion.user/97647</a> which noted the same exact issue.</p>

<p><strong>How do we solve this issue</strong><strong>?</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Create a test repository &ndash; svnadmin create /tmp/svntest which will create the fsfs.conf under /tmp/svntest/db/fsfs.conf</li>
<li>Copy the fsfs.conf to your svnroot/db directory and walla you have the fsfs.conf (what this file does is a different topic)</li>
</ol>


<p>Please note:</p>

<p>1. The svnadmin upgrade &ndash;<strong>Doesn&rsquo;t add this file so unless you are using an old veriosn of the hot-backup.py script your backups will fail!!!</strong> (beleive me I tried).</p>

<p>2. If you update subverison &ndash; don&rsquo;t forget to run <em>svnadmin upgrade /pathto yourrepo/</em> or you miss all the point of upgrading</p>

<p>So I&rsquo;ve learened that subversion was upgraded (again which doesn&rsquo;t say your repository was upgraded!!!) &ndash; but when? &ndash; considering the fact I am running CentOS &ndash; and I didn&rsquo;t have to compile SVN from source and start checking the subversion binaries Creation / Update time I used RPM to tell me when subverions was installed and there is was:</p>

<pre><code>[root@dev ~]# rpm -qi subversion
Name        : subversion                   Relocations: (not relocatable)

<p>I think the <a href="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%231">#1</a> lesson learned here is before you upgrade read the release notes, see if it impacts you environment in any way &ndash; then you can upgrade.</p>

<p>Hope you find this useful.</p>
