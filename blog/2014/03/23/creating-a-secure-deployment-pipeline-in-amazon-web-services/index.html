<div class="entry-content"><p>Many organizations require a secure infrastructure. I’ve yet to meet a customer that says that security isn’t a concern. But, the decision on “how secure?” should be closely associated with a risk analysis for your organization.</p>

<p>Since Amazon Web Services (AWS) is often referred to as a “public cloud”, people sometimes infer that “public” must mean it’s “out in the public” for all to see. I’ve always seen “public/private clouds” as an
unfortunate use of terms. In this context, public means more like
“Public Utility”. People often interpret “private clouds” to be
inherently more secure. Assuming that “public cloud” = less secure and
“private cloud” = more secure couldn’t be further from the truth. Like
most things, it’s all about how you architect your infrastructure. While
you can define your infrastructure to have open access, AWS provides
many tools to create a truly secure infrastructure while eliminating
access to all but only authorized users.</p>

<p>I’ve created an initial list of many of the practices we use. We don’t
employ all these practices in all situations, as it often depends on our
customers’ particular security requirements. But, if someone asked me
“How do I create a secure AWS infrastructure using a Deployment
Pipeline?”, I’d offer some of these practices in the solution. I’ll be
expanding these over the next few weeks, but I want to start with some
of our practices.</p>

<p><strong>AWS Security</strong></p>

<p>* After initial AWS account creation and login, configure
<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/iam/" title="AWS IAM">IAM</a> so that there’s no need to
use the AWS root account\
 * Apply least privilege to all IAM accounts. Be very careful about who
gets Administrator access.\
 * Enable all IAM password rules\
 * Enable MFA for all users\
 * Secure all data at rest\
 * Secure all data in transit\
 * Put all AWS resources in a <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/vpc/" title="Virtual Private Cloud">Virtual Private
Cloud</a> (VPC).\
 * No EC2 Key Pairs should be shared with others. Same goes for Access
Keys.\
 * Only open required ports to the Internet. For example, with the
exception of, say, port 80, no security groups should have a CIDR Source
of 0.0.0.0/0). The bastion host might have access to port 22 (SSH), but
you should enable
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing" title="CIDR">CIDR</a>
to limit access to specific subnets. Using a VPC is a part of a solution
to eliminate Internet access. No canonical environments should have
SSH/RDP access.\
 * Use IAM to limit access to specific AWS resources and/or
remove/limit AWS console access\
 * Apply a bastion host configuration to reduce your attack profile\
 * Use <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/iam-roles-for-amazon-ec2.html" title="IAM Roles">IAM
Roles</a>
so that there’s no need to configure Access Keys on the instances\
 * Use resource-level permissions in EC2 and RDS\
 * Use SSE to secure objects in S3 buckets\
 * Share initial IAM credentials with others through a secure mechanism
(e.g. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard" title="AES">AES-256
encryption</a>)\
 * Use and monitor AWS
<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudtrail/" title="AWS CloudTrail">CloudTrail</a> logs</p>

<p><strong>Deployment Pipeline</strong></p>

<p>A deployment pipeline is a staged process in which the complete software
system is built and tested with every change. Team members receive
feedback as it completes each stage. With most customers, we usually
construct between 4-7 deployment pipeline stages and the pipeline only
goes to the next stage if the previous stages were successful. If a
stage fails, the whole pipeline instance fails. The first stage (often
referred to as the “Commit Stage”) will usually take no more than 10
minutes to complete. Other stages may take longer than this. Most stages
require no human intervention as the software system goes through more
extensive testing on its way to production. With a deployment pipeline,
software systems can be released at any time the business chooses to do
so. Here are some of the security-based practices we employ in
constructing a deployment pipeline.</p>

<p>* Automate everything: Networking (VPC, Route 53) Compute (EC2),
Storage, etc. All <em>AWS</em> automation should be defined in
<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/" title="CloudFormation">CloudFormation</a>.
All environment configuration should be defined using infrastructure
automation scripts – such as Chef, Puppet, etc.\
 * Version Everything: Application Code, Configuration, Infrastructure
and Data\
 * Manage your binary dependencies. Be specific about binary version
numbers. Ensure you have control over these binaries.\
 * Lockdown pipeline environments. Do not allow SSH/RDP access to any
environment in the deployment pipeline\
 * For project that require it, use permissions on the CI server or
Deployment application to limit who can run deployments in certain
environments – such as QA, Pre-Production and Production. When you have
a policy in which all changes are applied through automation and
environments are locked down, this usually becomes less of a concern.
But, it can still be a requirements on some teams.\
 * Use the Disposable Environments pattern – instances are terminated
once every few days. This approach reduces the attack profile\
 * Log everything outside of the EC2 instances (so that they can be
access later). Ensure these log files are encrypted e.g. securely
through S3)\
 * All canonical changes are only applied through automation that are
part of the deployment pipeline. This includes application,
configuration, infrastructure and data change. Infrastructure patch
management would be a part of the pipeline just like any outer software
system change.\
 * No one has access to nor can make direct changes to pipeline
environments\
 * Create high-availability systems Multi-AZ, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/" title="Auto Scaling">Auto
Scaling</a>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/" title="ELB">Elastic
Load Balancing</a> and
Route 53\
 * For non-Admin AWS users, only provide access to AWS through a secure
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration" title="Continuous Integration">Continuous
Integration</a>
(CI) server or a self-service application\
 * Use Self-Service Deployments and give developers full SSH/RDP access
to their self-service deployment. Only their particular EC2 Key Pair can
access the instance(s) associated with the deployment. Self-Service
Deployments can be defined in the CI server or a lightweight
self-service application.\
 * Provide capability for any authorized user to perform a self-service
deployment with full SSH/RDP access to the environment they created
(while eliminating outside access)\
 * Run two active environments – We’ve yet to do this for customers,
but if you want to eliminate all access to the canonical production
environment, you might choose to run two active environments at once so
that engineers can access the non-production environment to troubleshoot
a problem in which the environment has the exact same configuration and
data so you’re troubleshooting accurately.\
 * Run automated infrastructure tests to test for security
vulnerabilities (e.g. cross-site scripting, SQL injections, etc.) with
every change committed to the version-control repository as part of the
deployment pipeline.</p>

<p><strong>FAQ</strong></p>

<p>* <strong>What is a canonical environment?</strong> It’s your system of record. You
want your canonical environment to be solely defined in source code and
versioned. If someone makes a change to the canonical system and it
affects everyone it should only be done through automation. While you
can use a self-service deployment to get a copy of the canonical system,
any direct change you make to the environment is isolated and never made
part of the canonical system unless code is committed to the
version-control repository.\
 * <strong>How can I troubleshoot if I cannot directly access canonical
environments?</strong> Using a self-service deployment, you can usually
determine the cause of the problem. If it’s a data-specific problem, you
might import a copy of the production database. If this isn’t possible
for time or security reasons, you might run multiple versions of the
application at once.\
 * <strong>Why should we dispose of environments regularly?</strong> Two primary
reasons. The first is to reduce your attack profile (i.e. if
environments always go up and down, it’s more difficult to hone in on
specific resources. The second reason is that it ensures that all team
members are used to applying all canonical changes through automation
and not relying on environments to always be up and running somewhere.\
 * <strong>Why should we lockdown environments?</strong> To prevent people from
making disruptive environment changes that don’t go through the
version-control repository.</p>
