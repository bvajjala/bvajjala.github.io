Yes I am a Hacker wannabe [Octopress slogen is &ldquo;A blogging framewrok for hackers&rdquo; &hellip; ].</p>

<p>Now seriously, i&rsquo;ve been down the road with many blog / CMS engines, <a href="http://ww.drupal.org">Drupal</a>, <a href="http://wordpress.org/">Wordpress</a> and all I really wanted was
a note-pad with no fancy WYSIWYG editor with a bazillion plug-ins which will enable me to embed images / videos or a simple syntax highlighter.</p>

<p>So I found <a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a> which is just frekin&#8217; simple to use + it&rsquo;s cheap [hosting on Github Pages]</p>

<blockquote><p>Octopress is a framework designed by Brandon Mathis for Jekyll, the blog aware static site generator powering Github Pages. To start blogging with Jekyll, you have to write your own HTML templates, CSS, Javascripts and set up your configuration. But with Octopress All of that is already taken care of. Simply clone or fork Octopress, install dependencies and the theme, and youâ€™re set.</p></blockquote>

<ul>
<li>Social links preloaded, Facebook, Twitter, disqus &amp; other are built-in</li>
<li>Syntax high-lighting built-in</li>
<li>there are more good reasons <a href="http://octopress.org/docs/">here</a> <a href="https://github.com/imathis/octopress/wiki/3rd-party-plugins">and here</a></li>
</ul>


<p>The only problem was / is migrating all the stuff I have on-line so that is still a work in progress &hellip;
&ndash;>So I guess I&rsquo;ll have to see if this ones sticks!&lt;&ndash;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>One of the problems I keep running into with Puppet is that the packages I&rsquo;m trying to install are very new and I need to run <code>apt-get update</code> to update the repositories. Because Puppet does not run scripts it gets rather annoying to get the update to run before you install any packages.</p>

<p>I found a lot of solutions around the web but this one seems to work best for me.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In the light of the recent <a href="http://rubygems.org">Rubygems.org</a> security compromise the community has been looking at ways to make Rubygems.org and Ruby gems in general more secure. The project is still ongoing and feel free to help them out on #rubygems on Freenode, but here is a highlight of what I think are some of the main issues.</p>

<p>Some of the issues highlighted here are taken from <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-5bO0Q1J9s">Ben Smith&rsquo;s enlightening (but scary) talk at Aloha Ruby Conference</a>.</p>

<h2>Disclaimer</h2>

<p>I am not a security expert. I am just a Ruby developer and a gem author that is worried about the current state of the Ruby gems ecosystem. I also am worried that the next negative news around Ruby will involve the problems described below.</p>

<h2>What are Ruby gems and what is Rubygems.org?</h2>

<p>For those not familiar, <a href="http://rubygems.org">Rubygems.org</a> is the most popular repository of &ldquo;gems&rdquo; for the <a href="http://rubylang.org">Ruby language</a>. Gems are libraries made up out of Ruby (and optionally C) code and can be uploaded by anyone who registered for an account. Rubygems.org currently hosts 50,685 gems which have been downloaded 1,259,533,358 times since July 2009. Ruby gems are not only hosted on Rubygems.org, anyone can run their own repository but Rubygems.org is definitely the most used one.</p>

<h2>Current state</h2>

<p>Some parts of the current infrastructure are worrying.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Hard to tell if gems were changed on the repo.</strong> It took the Rubygems.org volunteers more than 24 hours to verify every gem&rsquo;s checksum against external mirrors.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Impossible to tell if gems were uploaded by gem owner.</strong> It is currently very hard to know if a gem was actually uploaded by it&rsquo;s owner. Developer machines can be compromised and a users API credentials for Rubygems.org are kept unencrypted in <code>~/gem/credentials</code>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Gem owner isn&rsquo;t notified of new gem uploads.</strong> When a gem developer&rsquo;s credentials are compromised a new version of the gem can be uploaded without the gem owner ever knowing.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Impossible to notify a gem user of compromised gems.</strong> When a gem developer&rsquo;s credentials are compromised it is hard to notify anyone who uses any of the gems published by the developer of the situation.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Gems can run code on install.</strong> This is probably the most interesting attack vector in the foreseeable future. It seems this feature was relatively unintentional as it involves tying into the fact that Ruby gems can contain C code. Running code on install will mean that gems can steal the unencrypted Rubygems.org credentials which can then be used to modify the compromised user&rsquo;s gems and spread the malicious code further.</p></li>
</ul>


<h2>Proposals for change</h2>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Notify gem owners of newly published gems.</strong> Adding a simple email notification to the gem owner will at least allow for easier detection of compromised gems. Sadly at this point the gem is already compromised and possibly already spread over any mirrors and downloaded by users.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Secure developer&rsquo;s Rubygems.org credentials.</strong> This is pretty simple. My ssh key has a passphrase on it and so should my Rubygems.org credentials. Stealing a rubygems.org API key is easy, using one that requires a passphrase a lot harder.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Stop running code on gem install.</strong> I totally see the need for having C extensions in a Ruby gems, and those extensions need to be compiled, but we seriously need to find a way to compile C code without allowing for the arbitrary execution of code on install of a gem.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Automatically mirror gems and checksums.</strong>  A system involving the automatic mirroring of gems and their checksums to other servers would definitely have made the verification of gems a lot easier in the last few days.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Force signing of gems.</strong> Yes, <a href="http://docs.rubygems.org/read/chapter/21">you can sign your gems</a> but almost nobody does (and neither do I). Additionally it&rsquo;s a pain to force the usage of signed keys on the gem user&rsquo;s side, not to mention the futility as most gems aren&rsquo;t signed. Signing is the way to go though and work on this has started. It&rsquo;s a difficult topic though and work is being done to make it as painless as possible for users and developers.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Notify gem users of unsigned/insecure gems.</strong> The rubygem binary (together with tools like <a href="http://gembundler.com/">Bundler</a>) should be updated to allow for verification of signatures which will allow it to notify gem users of unsigned or compromised gems.</p></li>
</ul>


<h2>How can I help?</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Code:</strong> <a href="https://github.com/rubygems">rubygems</a>, <a href="https://github.com/rubygems-trust">rubygems-trust</a>(fork for implementing a signed approach)</li>
<li><strong>Discussion:</strong> #rubygems and #rubygems-trust on Freenode</li>
</ul>


<h2>Did I miss anything?</h2>

<p>Please let me know and I&rsquo;ll add it to the list.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&rsquo;ve been playing with <a href="http://puppetlabs.com/">Puppet</a> recently in order to finally teach myself a bit about server management. I decided for Puppet because&hellip; well&hellip; I didn&rsquo;t have time to play with <a href="http://www.opscode.com/chef/">Chef</a> yet.</p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t show any of my code because it contains some stuff I&rsquo;d rather not open up, but here are some of my global notes on Puppet that I wanted to share.</p>

<h2>The good</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>It did the job.</strong> I now have a few scripts that I can use to quickly setup a server for Rails, including NGINX, PostgreSQL, Unicorn, Monit, and much more.</li>
<li><strong>Quick deployment.</strong> I can now deploy a new Rails app to a server within minutes!</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://docs.puppetlabs.com/learning/">The Learning Puppet series</a></strong> is a good starting point and explains most of the basics</li>
<li><strong>Low tech.</strong> Running a puppet script really doesn&rsquo;t involve much more than running: <code>puppet apply path/to/puppet/file.pp</code></li>
</ul>


<h2>The bad</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>No single server deployment solution.</strong> There doesn&rsquo;t seem to be a best practice on how to use puppet with just one server. I know that the serious people will have to manage many many servers, but I think that they could make Puppet more accessible to newcomers by having a good solid solution for their own server. Many of us learn new things by trying them out for our own hobby projects before using them in big-business contexts. I have resorted to using Capistrano for deployment, but it just feels wrong somehow.</li>
<li><strong>Not many great modules.</strong> Puppet has a modules system which allows anyone to package their solutions and share them with the community. Sadly most of the modules are old, unmaintained, and often broken. Additionally the modules often don&rsquo;t solve the problems in a way that I&rsquo;d like them to, forcing me to write my own.</li>
<li><strong>Convoluted language.</strong> Puppet requires Ruby to run, but the DSL is not Ruby, nor is it Javascript, or JSON,or YAML, or anything else that so many developers already know. The architecture for defining classes, types, and modules is convoluted, backwards, and feels very awkward. I think one of the reasons why there aren&rsquo;t many well written modules is very much related to this.</li>
<li><strong>Compiling from source.</strong> One of the biggest missing features seems to be some good architecture for installing anything that isn&rsquo;t packaged up. I often want to run a different Ruby, Nginx, Apache, PHP version than is in the package repositories. I know this is a hard problem, but again I wish there was some kind of best practice.</li>
<li><strong>Ordering from hell.</strong> Puppet does not run your actions in order as specified in your <code>.pp</code> file. Instead you can tell it if something has a requirement. In my experience almost everything has a requirement and specifying the orders is becoming a nightmare and a real frustration.</li>
<li><strong>Missing features.</strong> There are a few features that are still missing. One of the most important ones (in my eyes) is the ability to generate a folder recursively (e.g. <code>mkdir -p path/with/multiple/folders</code>). Instead you are now forced to create every layer as a new statement.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Puppet will do for now, but I wish it was a bit more opinionated in how it thought it should be used. The language is not pretty and very verbose, and its lack of best practices for single server deployment is a real omission.</p>

<p>Does anyone know how Chef performs in these regards?</p>
