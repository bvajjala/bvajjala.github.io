  <div class="entry-content"><p><em>(Get the source code at <a href="https://github.com/themotleyfool/NuGet">https://github.com/themotleyfool/NuGet</a>)</em></p>

<p>Last time I wrote about creating a LINQ provider for Lucene.Net, and today I&rsquo;ll talk about integrating that provider
with NuGet. The existing server part of the NuGet codebase is a drop-in replacement for using local file-system based
feeds. I wanted to try to preserve that turnkey advantage but improve the performance of various queries.</p>

<p>In order to make sure that my improvements were up to snuff, I set up a private mirror of all packages on <a href="http://nuget.org/">nuget.org</a>,
which turned out to be 44,193 packages at the time, for a total size of over 20 gigs.</p>

<p>If you try hitting ~/api/v2/Packages on stock NuGet.Server, you&rsquo;ll find that your request just spins and spins. And spins. In fact
it took so long that I gave up waiting for the application to initialize. In the background, the server is finding all <code>*.nupkg</code>
files in ~/Packages and calculating a hash of the contents. Needless to say, it can take a while to run a checksum algorithm on 20gb
of data.</p>

<p>Switching over to my custom lucene branch, the first time the site is started, it scans the Packages folder and finds all packages
that haven&rsquo;t been indexed by Lucene. The site homepage helpfully tells you the current status, such as &ldquo;Indexing 2113 of 44193 new packages.&rdquo;
An ajax timer refreshes the info every few seconds so progress can be easily tracked.</p>

<p>The packages don&rsquo;t begin to appear in the feed until they&rsquo;ve all been indexed. So this isn&rsquo;t much better than stock NuGet.Server.</p>

<h2>Incremental Indexing</h2>

<p>The real improvements are appreciated after the initial index is built.</p>

<pre><code>[celdredge@localhost]$ appcmd recycle apppool nuget
"nuget" successfully recycled

[celdredge@localhost]$ time wget -O /dev/null http://localhost/api/v2/Packages

(snip)

real    0m3.230s
user    0m0.062s
sys     0m0.125s
</code></pre>

<p>This means that you don&rsquo;t have to worry much about IIS shutting down the application during idle times. The index gets loaded and ready to go
in a matter of seconds. Vast improvement over stock NuGet.Server.</p>

<p>While that happens, a background thread scans the Packages folder to see what might have changed while the application was stopped. New, modified
and deleted packages are synchronized with the Lucene index. The sycnhronization process takes about 25 seconds to scan 44,193 package files
split into 6,180 folders and calculate the differences with the Lucene index. That&rsquo;s pretty fast.</p>

<p>After the application finishes this initial scan, a FileSystemWatcher monitors the Packages folder to synchronize any changes in real time.
This allows the index to stay in sync when new packages appear, even if they are copied into the folder instead of using <code>nuget push</code>.</p>

<h2>Superfast Search</h2>

<p>All sorts of complex queries are possible, and they execute in very reasonable time. I used <a href="http://www.linqpad.net/">LINQPad</a> to
construct various test queries, like this one that finds packages whose id contain lucene but do not start with lucene:</p>

<pre><code>from p in Packages
where p.Id.Contains("Lucene")
where !p.Id.StartsWith("Lucene")
where p.IsLatestVersion
orderby p.Id descending
select p

Query successful (00:00.136)
</code></pre>

<p>136ms is pretty respectable, IMO.</p>

<p>Another advantage to using Lucene is how queries are analyzed. Term queries will match various word forms, so a query like <tt>build</tt> will
match packages that use any words like build, builds, building, built, etc. It is also possible to search for phrase queries, such as
<tt>&ldquo;glue them back together&rdquo;</tt>. That query matches only one package that contains the exact phrase, whereas on nuget.org you&rsquo;ll get
all kinds of results.</p>

<h2>Other Features</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/wiki/Tab-Completion-API-Endpoints">Tab Completion API Endpoints</a> introduced in NuGet 2.0 have
been implemented, bringing fast results to users of the Package Manager Console.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>It has taken a substantial amount of time and effort to implement Lucene.Net.Linq and integrate it with NuGet.Server, but the results
have proven to be worth the investment.</p>

<p>Lucene.Net.Linq has become a fairly mature, though still nascent, project now available on <a href="http://nuget.org/packages/Lucene.Net.Linq">nuget.org</a>. There are a few other
OSS projects that attempt to do what it does, but I think it is already one of the best.</p>

<p>Binaries of NuGet.Server + Lucene can be downloaded from <a href="https://github.com/themotleyfool/NuGet/downloads">https://github.com/themotleyfool/NuGet/downloads</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So last weekend I was at <a href="http://overtheair.org/">Over The Air 2012</a> &ndash; on of my favorite regular Hack days &ndash; and for the first time I decided to actually try and make a &ldquo;native&rdquo; mobile app.</p>

<p>Seeing as I don&rsquo;t want to have to redo the app for every platform I decided to try out one of the more famous cross platform development frameworks: <a href="http://phonegap.com/">PhoneGap</a>.</p>

<p>Here are some of the things I discovered during the weekend:</p>

<ul>
<li>PhoneGap isn&rsquo;t really a framework. It&rsquo;s really nothing more than a wrapper around a local HTML page with an extra JS library to access native features like the camera, local storage, etc.</li>
<li>Although <a href="http://jquerymobile.com/">jQuery Mobile</a> looks very nice, it seems to emulate iOS, making it look out of place on any Android or Windows device.</li>
<li>PhoneGap in combination with jQuery Mobile allows you to very quickly make a static native app, but as soon as you want to add any dynamics it seems to become quite hard. You will need some kind of JS MVC to tie it all together.</li>
<li>I had a play with <a href="http://knockoutjs.com/">KnockoutJS</a> &ndash; which we already use at <a href="http://emberads.com">EmberAds</a> &ndash; but it had its issues:

<ul>
<li>Good tutorials on how to integrate with jQuery Mobile were missing, and I was encountering rendering issues.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s not really a MVC, and tying it to template partials seemed harder than it should.</li>
<li>Automatic storage of models to local storage/server was missing.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p>So although I&rsquo;m happy with the work we did on the first version of our app it clearly will need a rewrite in time to be viable. Here&rsquo;s some of the research I&rsquo;ve done so far:</p>

<ul>
<li>I will probably replace Knockout with <a href="http://backbonejs.org/">BackboneJS</a> which seems to be more flexible and actually support storing to server and/or local storage.</li>
<li>Alternatively I might look at <a href="http://docs.sencha.com/touch/2-0/">Sensa Touch 2.0</a> which seems to be more than just a UI framework but actually also include a full MVC framework.</li>
<li>I found some tutorial describing how to integrate PhoneGap, jQuery Mobile, and Backbone, <a href="https://github.com/ccoenraets/backbone-directory/tree/master/jquerymobile">including a bootstrapped app</a> that integrates them all in a way I might be able to re-use.</li>
</ul>

  <div class="entry-content"><h3>tl;dr</h3>

<p>I want to run a new kind of event: <strong>OpenCodeCamp</strong> (working title). OpenCodeCamp should be an event that promotes knowledge sharing and skills swapping amongst developers of any age or level of experience. It should be free of commercialism, competition, sexism, racism, age-ism and accessible to developers of any seniority.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&rsquo;ve been attending HackDays since 2007 when I travelled to Alexandra Palace for the first <a href="http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/173371/LONDON/London/Yahoo-BBC-Hackday-2007/Alexandra-Palace/">HackDay organised by Yahoo and the BBC</a>. I was a n00b at that time (some might say I still am, #shakesfist) and I had no idea what to build. At the time I was trying to learn how to use web frameworks and at the HackDay I got my first exposures to APIs, Django, Rails, OpenID and much more. I don&rsquo;t think I made anything that weekend, but damn did I learn a lot!</p>

<p>Since then we&rsquo;ve come a long way; HackDays are no longer just organised by big organisations. There&rsquo;s pretty much one happening every weekend (sometimes more), and they are more often than not focussed around a topic. I attended at least 20 HackDays since, and I even helped organise <a href="http://www.hackcamp.org.uk/">not 1 but 2 HackCamps</a> with <a href="http://geeksoflondon.com">GeeksOfLondon</a>.</p>

<p>But lately I&rsquo;ve been noticing a little trend. I was at <a href="http://www.gamehack.co.uk/">GameHack</a> yesterday and I had come to have a fun weekend to play with some APIs, maybe play with some WebGL libraries, and get an idea of how game development works. I am not a game developer and don&rsquo;t intend to be one, but I always enjoy learning new things.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Here are just some interesting gems and other software that have caught my attention recently:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh">oh-my-zsh</a> makes it easy to use zshell as a replacement for bash on OS X. It is very easy to install and comes with a whole bunch of useful plugins. I&rsquo;ve only really dived half into it but already feel like it&rsquo;s been making my console better. I personally love how it shows the Git branch I&rsquo;m working on at the moment.</li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom_filter">Bloom Filters</a> are a very cool way of doing a quick and space efficient lookup if an item exists in a set. It&rsquo;s used by databases and caches, and Google uses it for their Save Browsing service. There&rsquo;s some cool <a href="https://github.com/igrigorik/bloomfilter-rb">ruby gems</a> that make it easy to use them and I already have an idea where to deploy them next.</li>
<li><a href="http://zachholman.com/talk/how-github-uses-github-to-build-github">How Github uses Github</a> is pretty much how we use Github at EmberAds. The more we do it the more I see the benefits especially:

<ul>
<li>We work asynchronously</li>
<li>We use the hell out of Campfire</li>
<li>Master is always deployable</li>
<li>Pull Requests are our code reviews, requests for comments, and discussion boards.</li>
<li>Other apps have great features like prioritising stuff. But honestly, we have barely touched BaseCamp in weeks.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/EmberAds/cuuid">Fast UUID generation</a> is something we needed at EmberAds seeing as we use UUIDs everywhere and most of the Ruby gems were rather slow.    <a href="http://caius.name">Caius</a> cooked up a Ruby gem that uses a native C library which in our simple benchmarks spit out UUIDs about 6x faster.</li>
<li>On that note, <a href="https://github.com/EmberAds/acts_as_uuid">acts_as_uuid</a> is what we use to store UUIDs on our models in Postgres.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/ondrejbartas/rake-progressbar">Rake progressbar</a> makes it easier for me to understand if I can go and make a brew or not when some of my rake tasks are running.</li>
<li>And finally, static site generators like <a href="http://nanoc.stoneship.org/">Nanoc</a>, <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll">Jekyll</a>, and <a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a> (used on this site) have been really catching my eye lately. Mainly because of the security and scaling implications. I&rsquo;ve been working on a blog post on this, mainly to inspire regular bloggers that you don&rsquo;t need a big server and a massive database to render a Wordpress site that will load slow as hell regardless.</li>
</ul>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It has been a while since I last blogged, and to be fair I&rsquo;ve been kinda busy, but I also was frustrated with my old blog. It was bloated and heavy to load, all mainly due to Wordpress and Site5&rsquo;s shared hosting. Wordpress started as a nice blogging platform but lately it has been pissing me off (more on this), and I realised that running a whole PHP script for pages that barely ever change is stupid.</p>

<p>I noticed recently that the download count of the packages in my <a href="https://github.com/kmees/Octopress-NuGet-Aside">NuGet Aside</a> didn&rsquo;t update properly. As I <a href="/blog/2012/02/29/nuget-aside-for-octopress/">mentioned earlier</a>, I use the <a href="https://developers.google.com/feed/">Google Feed API</a> to get the data from the NuGet Gallery feed of an author. This indicrection is needed because the NuGet Gallery API doesn&rsquo;t support the <strong>jsonp</strong> response type (yet). Anyway, the problem is that Google caches the feeds heavily and only adds new entries but doesn&rsquo;t update existing ones. This means that the packages keep their download count of the first request.</p>
