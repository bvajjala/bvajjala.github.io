<p>This series piqued my interest given that I&rsquo;ve been working on Lucene.Net.Linq and integrating it with NuGet.Server. I haven&rsquo;t worked
directly with RavenDB, but I have used some products like Octopus Deploy which uses RavenDB. It seems like a pretty cool product and
I don&rsquo;t have anything against it. However, there are some problems with the blog series that might lead the casual reader
to be misled about what has been accomplished, especially with regards to declarations of victory and some misleading
performance numbers.</p>

<p>I know the blog series is only meant to show off RavenDB and give potential users an idea of what their code might look like,
but nonetheless some hefty claims are made about performance in comparison to the Entity Framework / SQL Server solution in
use at <a href="http://nuget.org/">nuget.org</a>. Let&rsquo;s take a look.</p>

<h2>Pick a Schema, Any Schema Will Do</h2>

<p>Of course if you&rsquo;re going to model data in a new persistence layer, it makes perfect sense to simplify or improve the
way your data is stored and indexed for later retrieval. Ayende points out some problems with the dense, non-semantic
way some fields are stored in nuget, such as dependency versions and tags. He uses these as examples that illustrate
how RavenDB can handle nested collections of strings and complex objects.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s great and all, but if we&rsquo;re redesigning the schema, we&rsquo;ve already changed the rules. Nuget.org is having some
trouble specifically because of a poorly designed schema that requires too many joins and some other complex hoop-jumping
to execute some frequently used queries.</p>

<p>Furthermore, regardless of how the data is stored behind the server, NuGet uses an OData API to expose its packages
to clients. If you change the schema, you have to do it in a way that remains compatible with that client API, or
the millions of installed instances suddenly stop working.</p>

<h2>Semantic Version Sort vs. Lexical Sort</h2>

<p>One of the primary ways that packages are sorted in NuGet is by version. Unfortunately, the complex nature of
semantic versions, such as 0.9-alpha or 1.0.5, makes it impossible to sort them correctly using a basic lexical sort.
For example, 1.0-alpha should get sorted before 1.0, and 1.2 should get sorted before 1.10. With lexical sort
they do not.</p>

<p>This problem was pointed out in a comment on <a href="http://ayende.com/blog/158210/nuget-perf-part-ivndash-modeling-the-packages">Part IV</a>
but left unresolved.</p>

<h2>Review</h2>

<p>In using NuGet as an example for RavenDB, the following features are not addressed:</p>

<ol>
<li>Providing a backwards-compatible OData endpoint</li>
<li>Sorting correctly by package version</li>
<li>Storing and retrieving package contents (only package metadata is addressed)</li>
<li>Adding new packages into the index</li>
<li>Keeping track of download counters (per-package and total)</li>
</ol>


<p>Without addressing adding new packages and tracking downloads, the data store is effectively read-only,
meaning that caches never get invalidated and there are no writes to disk. Based on this criteria, is
it really fair to compare performance benchmarks between this sample and a real, production system?</p>

<h2>The Load Tests</h2>

<p>In the next part of the series, the sample system is put under some load to see what kind of performance
RavenDB can provide when there are concurrent users. <a href="http://ayende.com/blog/158530/nuget-perf-the-final-part-ndash-load-testing-ndash-the-tests">The Tests</a>
goes into some detail about the load testing plan.</p>

<p>Reviewing the load test, we have another obvious problem: only a handful of sample queries are being used.
When the number of search queries is low, say, under 10, the system under load can simply cache the results
from the previous time the query was executed and return that to the user. Since there isn&rsquo;t any variance
in which columns are used to sort, what page is retrieved, etc., the system under load doesn&rsquo;t have to think
very hard at all.</p>

<p>Combine the simplicity of the test plan with the fact that the system under test is not doing any writes at all,
and you might as well be slinging static html at that point. I guess it does validate, if nothing else, that
the caching built into RavenDB works.</p>

<p>One indicator that the load test isn&rsquo;t really hitting any critical thresholds is that Pages/Sec grows pretty
linearly as User Load ramps up. If the system hit such a threshold, one would expect Pages/Sec to peak at
a certain rate and (ideally) sustain that rate as concurrency continues to grow.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>To reiterate, I&rsquo;m not trying to bash RavenDB, which I&rsquo;m sure is an awesome product and probably really would
perform very effectively under load similar to that experienced by <a href="http://nuget.org/">nuget.org</a>. However,
casual observers may come away with unrealistic expectations after reading the performance results offered
up on <a href="http://ayende.com">ayende.com</a>.</p>

<h2>Why Do I Care</h2>

<p>If Ayende had picked virtually any example other than NuGet packages to do a blog series on, I probably would have
read along and not thought much about any of it. But having worked on NuGet.Server + Lucene.Net.Linq for
several months earlier this year, the subject matter is near and dear to my heart.</p>

<p>In future posts I&rsquo;ll get into some more compare and contrast on RavenDB vs. <a href="https://github.com/themotleyfool/Lucene.Net.Linq">Lucene.Net.Linq</a>
and maybe do a load test of my own of our <a href="https://github.com/themotleyfool/NuGet/downloads">custom NuGet.Server builds</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&rsquo;ve mentioned a few times that my team has been using <a href="http://octopusdeploy.com/">Octopus Deploy</a> in a few of my posts.
Now I&rsquo;ll describe in more detail some of the ways we&rsquo;ve integrated with Octopus that may help others.</p>

<h2>The Before Times</h2>

<p>Octopus started a beta phase in late 2011, so what were we doing before? Since I started working in an asp.net shop
in 2006, I&rsquo;ve been surprised by the lack of robust deployment tools for the ecosystem.</p>

<p>The Web Deployment Projects system provided by Microsoft has always seemed like a non-starter for me. When you
have mature processes like version control, continuous integration, automated testing, and quality assurance,
how does it make sense to hand the keys over to a developer running Visual Studio to click &ldquo;Deploy&rdquo;
on their desktop? What guarantee do you have that the code has been checked in, that it builds, that
the tests pass, that QA signed off?</p>

<p>Even if you only give trusted users permission to deploy, I&rsquo;ve never understood how it makes sense that you
would need Visual Studio to deploy your projects. I mean, Visual Studio is for development. It isn&rsquo;t even
needed by a build server to compile your code. But now QA (or whoever is allowed to perform deployments) needs
to have Visual Studio installed somewhere and checkout the code and build it themselves? So much for automation.
So much for predictability. So much for repeatability.</p>

<p>So it was with a lack of viable alternatives that I started writing a deployment tool in 2007. The tool was
named Bazooka (because it &ldquo;shoots&rdquo; software onto servers), and we used it for 5 years. We never released it as
open source because it made several assumptions particular to us and we didn&rsquo;t take the time to clean it up.</p>

<p>Bazooka was a web application that watched a directory for release candidates to show up as they were
prepared by our build server. Each release candidate contained a deployment descriptor that had some
meta data and a list of components that could be deployed to servers that matched certain roles like
WebServer or AppServer.</p>

<p>Bazooka used xml configuration for everything. The deployment descriptor was xml, the server and environment
configuration was xml, the permissions were xml, and the log files that recorded what had been deployed where
were also xml. This made Bazooka pretty slow as deployment logs piled up, but it beat the heck out of
doing anything more heavy-weight with sql.</p>

<p>Bazooka was, in reality, just a web interface to MSBuild. When you went through the deployment wizard,
Bazooka simply executed MSBuild in the directory specified by each component with some properties saying
which server to deploy to, which target to execute, what the environment was, etc.</p>

<p>We could have easily kept improving Bazooka, but we had actual code to write for our business, so Bazooka
had some weaknesses that we never really addressed. For example, managing servers and environments was
done by hand-editing the xml files. We didn&rsquo;t build a UI for that. Also, it was pretty tough to answer
simple questions like, &ldquo;What was the most recent deployment of my project to the staging environment?&rdquo;</p>

<p>But it worked as a fine stand-in for 5 years until someone built something better.</p>

<h2>Octopus Trial</h2>

<p>It was fun playing with Octopus during the beta period and seeing another approach to a web based
deployment tool. In the beginning there were plenty of things Bazooka had that Octopus didn&rsquo;t (yet),
but development has been pretty rapid with Octopus delivering frequent releases.</p>

<p>The one time where we asked if using Octopus was right was when Paul Stovell, the creator/developer
of Octopus Deploy, took a few months to rewrite the persistence layer, converting it from Entity
Framework to RavenDB. It was the right decision to make and we&rsquo;re happy in the long run, but we
found ourselves in a lurch waiting for some important features and bugfixes. We came out fine on
the other side though.</p>

<p>We also found that using a local file-based NuGet feed with Octopus doesn&rsquo;t scale very well, and
switching to NuGet Server provided no benefit either. This inspired us to create a
<a href="https://github.com/themotleyfool/NuGet">custom fork</a> of NuGet Server that uses
<a href="http://incubator.apache.org/lucene.net/">Lucene.Net</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/themotleyfool/Lucene.Net.Linq">Lucene.Net.Linq</a> to provide a scalable, lightning fast internal feed for Octopus.</p>

<h2>The Switch</h2>

<p>As we integrated some pilot projects with Octopus, we slowly stopped using Bazooka and
eventually turned off Bazooka integration. Some quick stats of our Octopus configuration today:</p>

<ul>
<li>48 projects</li>
<li>18,080 release candidates</li>
<li>1,405 deployments</li>
</ul>


<p>Octopus has done a decent job managing our high demands. We have experienced some slow page
loads here and there, but Paul has been very responsive about troubleshooting and optimizing
these.</p>

<h2>Reusing Deployment Scripts</h2>

<p>Since we already had a highly automated deployment system, we wanted to preserve our exising
capabilities while finding ways to improve the system.</p>

<p>One problem that Octopus doesn&rsquo;t solve for you is how to share deployment scripts across
projects. By default, Octopus will execute deployment scripts contained in each project,
but there isn&rsquo;t a built-in or standard way to reuse common functionality.</p>

<p>One of the first projects we set up in Octopus we named OctopusScripts. This project
consists of a collection of PowerShell modules that we want to be available everywhere.
When we deploy the project, the deployment scripts install the modules into a
standard location where PowerShell will probe for them. Then from other projects,
we can simply start a script with:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>Import-Module SmokeTest</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h2>Reuse Moar</h2>

<p>Moving most of our scripts into PowerShell modules was working great, but we started
to notice that our Deploy.ps1 scripts still looked awfully repetitious.</p>

<p>All of our web projects follow the same basic deployment recipe:</p>

<ol>
<li>PreDeploy

<ol>
<li>Disable machine in load balancer</li>
<li>Create IIS site and app pool definitions if missing</li>
<li>Update site host-header bindings as needed</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Let Octopus update the document root to point to the new application</li>
<li>PostDeploy

<ol>
<li>Execute smoke tests against the server and abort if any URLs return a non-200 response</li>
<li>Enable machine in load balancer</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>


<p>Of course we have different configurations and different URLs to use for smoke tests
for each project. We ended up creating a configuration based, modular script collection
so that each project simply needs to include a stub:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>Import-Module Fool-Octopus
</span><span class='line'>Invoke-OctopusDeploymentTasks</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The Invoke-OctopusDeploymentTasks function looks at whatever variable and configuration
are present and figure out which steps to execute. The same scripts are used for Windows
Service type projects and others too, and they figure out based on conventions if they
need to run web steps, create services, etc.</p>

<p>If the stub is missing from a project (because why duplicate the stub?) our build scripts
automatically insert a stub Deploy.ps1, PreDeploy.ps1 and PostDeploy.ps1.</p>

<p>We think we&rsquo;re about as DRY as we can get with regards to our deployment scripts.</p>

<h2>Ad-hoc PowerShell</h2>

<p>One thing we&rsquo;d like to see that hasn&rsquo;t made it into Octopus yet is the concept of ad-hoc
powershell scripts. Basically, we want to be able to run some arbitrary scripts during a
deployment, only once. It doesn&rsquo;t need to run once on each machine being deployed to, just
once and then done. There&rsquo;s a <a href="https://trello.com/card/new-deployment-step-ad-hoc-powershell/4e907de70880ba000079b75c/8">story card</a>
on Paul&rsquo;s Trello board that we&rsquo;re looking forward to. In the mean time, we&rsquo;ve been emulating
this behavior by deploying a small package to a dummy server and letting the script run there.</p>

<p>We mostly want this feature to simplify tasks such as sending email/other notifications when
deployments are beginning or completed. It might also be useful for a green/blue style
deployment model where the load balancer needs to toggle just once after the servers
have been updated.</p>

<p>Without the Ad-hoc feature, one of the stumbling points we run into is sometimes forgetting
to check the &ldquo;Force redeployment&rdquo; checkbox that Octopus leaves unchecked. When we forget,
some steps get skipped leading to confusing results.</p>

<h2>Looking Ahead</h2>

<p>Because of the level of automation we integrated with Octopus, our business is able to
deploy software more frequently and more reliably than ever before. In the coming
months and years, we look forward to seeing improvements in Octopus features that will
help us with cloud deployments to AWS or Azure. Octopus has definitely filled a gap
in our deployment capabilities, allowing us to deliver value to our business quickly,
iteratively and predictably.</p>

<time datetime="2012-08-20T13:56:00-04:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Aug 20<span>th</span>, 2012</time>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="/blog/2012/08/07/how-the-motley-fool-uses-nuget/">Last time</a>
I talked about how my development team progressed from having all
of our .net code in a single repository with a single solution to using a more
modular architecture complete with encapsulated domains.</p>

<p>When we started using this appraoch, we were still limited in a few ways:</p>

<ul>
<li>Everyone needs to integrate with the newest code</li>
<li>Difficult to patch an old version of a dependency</li>
<li>Cascading failures on the build server</li>
</ul>


<p>Even though we broke the ProjectReference rats nest, we still had an
implicit dependency on various shared code. It all had to be checked out
and built in the right order.</p>

<h2>Binary Package Management</h2>

<p>The next logical step was to further decouple our shared code by
packaging it up and publishing those packages. If we could do that,
we could decide when to upgrade dependencies on a product by product
basis.</p>

<p>There are two package managers in the .net ecosystem: OpenWrap and NuGet.</p>

<p>When we started shopping around, OpenWrap had been around longer and seemed
to be a better choice. There&rsquo;s a <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4256994/openwrap-vs-nuget">comparison of the products</a>
on stackoverflow.</p>

<p>We worked with OpenWrap for over 6 months and during that time started
to find some problems around integration with Visual Studio and ReSharper.
OpenWrap wants to manage dependencies per solution, and we have many cases
where we want to control dependencies at a per project level. We also
started to notice that NuGet was getting new versions released on a fairly
regular schedule, while OpenWrap 2.0 was in unstable beta limbo for over
a year.</p>

<p>Around the same time we started playing with <a href="http://octopusdeploy.com/">Octopus Deploy</a>
for deploying our code. Since Octopus uses NuGet packages for deployment, we
figured it would make sense to standardize on one package management system
for both deployments and dependency management. It&rsquo;s true that those are
separate problem spaces, but having less build scripts is always a good thing.</p>

<h2>Thoughts on NuGet</h2>

<h3>Conventions</h3>

<p>NuGet has several conventions that make it easy to create simple packages
that others can reference. You can share assemblies and content easily,
and when you want to customize anything there are some powershell extension
points you can hook into.</p>

<p>One problem we run into is that when building packages, sometimes there&rsquo;s
a NuGet convention we want to customize or suppress, and often we can&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>For example, if you create a <code>nuspec</code> and place it adjacent to a <code>csproj</code>
file, NuGet will look at the project and automatically inject metadata
and content into the package. For some things, you can override this
behavior with explicit specifications in the nuspec, but the behavior
can be surprising and confusing.</p>

<h3>Dependency Scoping</h3>

<p>NuGet supports the concept of transitive dependencies&hellip; sort of. If you
install package A, and A depends on package B, NuGet will go find a version
of B and install it while installing A. However, NuGet doesn&rsquo;t do any record
keeping to remember that B is a transitive dependency. To your project, A and
B appear simply as direct dependencies.</p>

<p>There may be cases where A depends on B at runtime, but consumers of A
shouldn&rsquo;t need to code against B at design time.</p>

<p>There may be other cases where B is an optional dependency for A, and
A can be used without it.</p>

<p>Since NuGet doesn&rsquo;t have a concept of scope, it only has one simplistic
approach to dealing with transitive dependencies: treat them just like
direct dependencies.</p>

<h3>Upgrade Behavior</h3>

<p>When you ask NuGet to update a specific package, it will first look for
updates to transitive dependencies that the package depends on. This may
seem obvious or desirable to some, but personally I find it confusing.
You can control this behavior with the <code>-IgnoreDependencies</code> flag in
the Package Management Console, but oddly you don&rsquo;t get that option
in the command line <code>nuget.exe</code> or from the Visual Studio GUI Package
Manager.</p>

<h3>Package Feed Performance</h3>

<p>We use continuous integration, and every successful build produces
&ldquo;release candidate&rdquo; versions of packages. We generate 50 to 100 packages
a day.</p>

<p>Using the simple NuGet UNC share quickly failed to scale, so next we tried
NuGet.Server and found that it doesn&rsquo;t perform well either.</p>

<p>NuGet Gallery seemed like overkill with its SQL Server requirement, so
I started optimizing NuGet.Server. This project ended up taking quite
a while, but the good news is that the fruits of the labor are now
open source on GitHub at <a href="https://github.com/themotleyfool/NuGet">https://github.com/themotleyfool/NuGet</a>.</p>

<h3>Refactoring Applications and Shared Code</h3>

<p>We try to use <a href="http://semver.org/">Semantic Versioning</a> to communicate
breaking changes in the packages we publish, so sometimes when
we want to use a refactoring tool like Change Method Signature
or Use Base Class it would be nice to have application and shared
code loaded into a single instance of Visual Studio.</p>

<p>We created a tool called <a href="https://github.com/TheMotleyFool/SlimJim">SlimJim</a>
that generates these Solution files on the fly.</p>

<p>If you create a Solution with application code and shared library code,
ReSharper will be smart enough to apply refactoring tools across the projects
even though ProjectReference style references are not being used.</p>

<p>However, Visual Studio won&rsquo;t know the correct order to build projects in,
and won&rsquo;t automatically copy outputs from shared libraries over to applications.</p>

<p>We extended SlimJim to convert assembly references to project references and back
to address this limitation.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>In terms of capability and maturity, we&rsquo;re in a much better place than
we were a few years ago. However, we still have a ways to go in terms of
productivity and workflow.</p>

<p>NuGet has helped us move in the right direction and we hope to see
further enhancements and even contribute some more of our own as we
develop them.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This post describes how we came to using binary package management. In the next part I&rsquo;ll get into NuGet.</p>

<p>In the beginning, there was one repository and it held all the projects for The Motley Fool, and it was good.
There were around a dozen asp.net web projects, a smattering of service and console apps, and a bunch of class libraries
to hold shared code. There was one Solution (sln) to rule them all.</p>

<p>As time went on, we found that there are downsides to the one-giant-solution approach to .net development:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.laputan.org/mud/">Big Ball of Mud</a></li>
<li>Slow builds</li>
<li>Tight coupling</li>
<li>Configuration hell</li>
<li>Hard to release different applications on different schedules</li>
</ul>


<p>Typically our larger applications would be split into several projects following a typical N-tier layered architecture:</p>

<ul>
<li>Web</li>
<li>Service</li>
<li>Domain</li>
<li>Data Access</li>
</ul>


<p>Despite our attempts to encapsulate data access and domain logic behind the service project, code ended up leaking out
to the point where domain projects were using types and methods from unrelated domain projects. Cats and dogs were
sleeping together.</p>

<p>Around this time Steven Bohlen presented a <a href="http://unhandled-exceptions.com/blog/index.php/2010/11/27/dc-altnet-presentationthats-a-wrap/">talk</a>
to the Washington DC Alt.NET User Group titled &ldquo;Domain Driven Design Implementation Patterns in .NET&rdquo;. While some of us
were already familiar with concepts of DDD, this talk lit a spark for us to try fixing our big ball of mud.</p>

<p>In late 2010 we started to make some changes. Instead of having one giant repository, shared code would be split out
into separate repositories. We also took this opportunity to introduce a new project organization and architecture.</p>

<p>We established one repository to hold utility code, broken into specific class libraries:</p>

<ul>
<li><tt>Fool.Abstractions</tt> &ndash; similar in spirit to System.Web.Abstractions; adds interfaces and wrappers to various FCL types that lack them</li>
<li><tt>Fool.Lang</tt> &ndash; similar in spirit to <a href="http://commons.apache.org/lang/">Jakarta Commons Lang</a>; adds general utility classes and methods not found elsewhere</li>
<li>Other projects that extend 3rd party class libraries to make them easier for us to work with in standardized ways.</li>
</ul>


<p>Then we established another repository to hold Domain Driven, er, Domains. For example, many of our applications and web sites deal with
stock market data, so one of our business domains is Quotes. In the Quotes Domain we have these projects:</p>

<ul>
<li><tt>Fool.Quotes</tt> &ndash; contains service interfaces and value types; serves as an API to the domain</li>
<li><tt>Fool.Quotes.Core</tt> &ndash; contains domain logic, models, and entities; serves as a private implementation</li>
<li><tt>Fool.Quotes.Web.Api</tt> &ndash; exposes Fool.Quotes interfaces over a RESTful web API</li>
</ul>


<p>The key to keeping our domains distinct and decoupled is to keep Core projects private. While Core is required at runtime,
it should never be referenced at compile time. To bridge the gap, we use Dependency Injection to provide concrete implementations.</p>

<p>Domains may depend on other domains provided that they consume each other through the API project. That way entities and business logic
are kept focused on their own concerns and don&rsquo;t leak out to other problem areas where they don&rsquo;t fit.</p>

<h2>Gluing It Together</h2>

<p>Having projects split into different repositories and different solutions meant that we couldn&rsquo;t simply have one mega Solution
that includes everything. That&rsquo;s by design, so good on us. But this introduces a problem in that we still need to reference code
from our utility projects and DDD projects in our applications. The first solution we came up with to handle this problem was
to use the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/wkze6zky.aspx">AssemblyFolders</a> registry to have our libraries
appear in the <tt>Add Reference</tt> dialog. Then to solve the runtime dependency on our private Core assemblies, we install
those to the GAC so they can be loaded using reflection by our IoC container.</p>

<p>This approach worked fine, mostly. But we encountered some downsides after using it for a while:</p>

<ul>
<li>Need to have all library code checked out and built on each development machine</li>
<li>No built-in way to manage different versions of the same dependency</li>
<li><a href="http://www.sellsbrothers.com/Posts/Details/12503">GAC considered harmful</a></li>
<li>Hard to debug build errors and runtime errors</li>
</ul>


<p>Using Continuous Integration means we&rsquo;re producing new builds dozens of times a day, so it isn&rsquo;t practical for us to
manage different assembly versions for each build. Like most shops, we leave our assembly versions at 1.0.0.0 despite
injecting actual version information into the AssemblyInformationalVersion attribute.</p>

<p>In order to support parallel development, we needed to find a more flexible way of managing dependencies, and
at this point we started to look at binary package management.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><em>(Get the source code at <a href="https://github.com/themotleyfool/NuGet">https://github.com/themotleyfool/NuGet</a>)</em></p>

<p>Last time I wrote about creating a LINQ provider for Lucene.Net, and today I&rsquo;ll talk about integrating that provider
with NuGet. The existing server part of the NuGet codebase is a drop-in replacement for using local file-system based
feeds. I wanted to try to preserve that turnkey advantage but improve the performance of various queries.</p>

<p>In order to make sure that my improvements were up to snuff, I set up a private mirror of all packages on <a href="http://nuget.org/">nuget.org</a>,
which turned out to be 44,193 packages at the time, for a total size of over 20 gigs.</p>

<p>If you try hitting ~/api/v2/Packages on stock NuGet.Server, you&rsquo;ll find that your request just spins and spins. And spins. In fact
it took so long that I gave up waiting for the application to initialize. In the background, the server is finding all <code>*.nupkg</code>
files in ~/Packages and calculating a hash of the contents. Needless to say, it can take a while to run a checksum algorithm on 20gb
of data.</p>

<p>Switching over to my custom lucene branch, the first time the site is started, it scans the Packages folder and finds all packages
that haven&rsquo;t been indexed by Lucene. The site homepage helpfully tells you the current status, such as &ldquo;Indexing 2113 of 44193 new packages.&rdquo;
An ajax timer refreshes the info every few seconds so progress can be easily tracked.</p>

<p>The packages don&rsquo;t begin to appear in the feed until they&rsquo;ve all been indexed. So this isn&rsquo;t much better than stock NuGet.Server.</p>

<h2>Incremental Indexing</h2>

<p>The real improvements are appreciated after the initial index is built.</p>

<pre><code>[celdredge@localhost]$ appcmd recycle apppool nuget
"nuget" successfully recycled

[celdredge@localhost]$ time wget -O /dev/null http://localhost/api/v2/Packages

(snip)

real    0m3.230s
user    0m0.062s
sys     0m0.125s
</code></pre>

<p>This means that you don&rsquo;t have to worry much about IIS shutting down the application during idle times. The index gets loaded and ready to go
in a matter of seconds. Vast improvement over stock NuGet.Server.</p>

<p>While that happens, a background thread scans the Packages folder to see what might have changed while the application was stopped. New, modified
and deleted packages are synchronized with the Lucene index. The sycnhronization process takes about 25 seconds to scan 44,193 package files
split into 6,180 folders and calculate the differences with the Lucene index. That&rsquo;s pretty fast.</p>

<p>After the application finishes this initial scan, a FileSystemWatcher monitors the Packages folder to synchronize any changes in real time.
This allows the index to stay in sync when new packages appear, even if they are copied into the folder instead of using <code>nuget push</code>.</p>

<h2>Superfast Search</h2>

<p>All sorts of complex queries are possible, and they execute in very reasonable time. I used <a href="http://www.linqpad.net/">LINQPad</a> to
construct various test queries, like this one that finds packages whose id contain lucene but do not start with lucene:</p>

<pre><code>from p in Packages
where p.Id.Contains("Lucene")
where !p.Id.StartsWith("Lucene")
where p.IsLatestVersion
orderby p.Id descending
select p

Query successful (00:00.136)
</code></pre>

<p>136ms is pretty respectable, IMO.</p>

<p>Another advantage to using Lucene is how queries are analyzed. Term queries will match various word forms, so a query like <tt>build</tt> will
match packages that use any words like build, builds, building, built, etc. It is also possible to search for phrase queries, such as
<tt>&ldquo;glue them back together&rdquo;</tt>. That query matches only one package that contains the exact phrase, whereas on nuget.org you&rsquo;ll get
all kinds of results.</p>

<h2>Other Features</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/wiki/Tab-Completion-API-Endpoints">Tab Completion API Endpoints</a> introduced in NuGet 2.0 have
been implemented, bringing fast results to users of the Package Manager Console.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>It has taken a substantial amount of time and effort to implement Lucene.Net.Linq and integrate it with NuGet.Server, but the results
have proven to be worth the investment.</p>

<p>Lucene.Net.Linq has become a fairly mature, though still nascent, project now available on <a href="http://nuget.org/packages/Lucene.Net.Linq">nuget.org</a>. There are a few other
OSS projects that attempt to do what it does, but I think it is already one of the best.</p>

<p>Binaries of NuGet.Server + Lucene can be downloaded from <a href="https://github.com/themotleyfool/NuGet/downloads">https://github.com/themotleyfool/NuGet/downloads</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So last weekend I was at <a href="http://overtheair.org/">Over The Air 2012</a> &ndash; on of my favorite regular Hack days &ndash; and for the first time I decided to actually try and make a &ldquo;native&rdquo; mobile app.</p>

<p>Seeing as I don&rsquo;t want to have to redo the app for every platform I decided to try out one of the more famous cross platform development frameworks: <a href="http://phonegap.com/">PhoneGap</a>.</p>

<p>Here are some of the things I discovered during the weekend:</p>

<ul>
<li>PhoneGap isn&rsquo;t really a framework. It&rsquo;s really nothing more than a wrapper around a local HTML page with an extra JS library to access native features like the camera, local storage, etc.</li>
<li>Although <a href="http://jquerymobile.com/">jQuery Mobile</a> looks very nice, it seems to emulate iOS, making it look out of place on any Android or Windows device.</li>
<li>PhoneGap in combination with jQuery Mobile allows you to very quickly make a static native app, but as soon as you want to add any dynamics it seems to become quite hard. You will need some kind of JS MVC to tie it all together.</li>
<li>I had a play with <a href="http://knockoutjs.com/">KnockoutJS</a> &ndash; which we already use at <a href="http://emberads.com">EmberAds</a> &ndash; but it had its issues:

<ul>
<li>Good tutorials on how to integrate with jQuery Mobile were missing, and I was encountering rendering issues.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s not really a MVC, and tying it to template partials seemed harder than it should.</li>
<li>Automatic storage of models to local storage/server was missing.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p>So although I&rsquo;m happy with the work we did on the first version of our app it clearly will need a rewrite in time to be viable. Here&rsquo;s some of the research I&rsquo;ve done so far:</p>

<ul>
<li>I will probably replace Knockout with <a href="http://backbonejs.org/">BackboneJS</a> which seems to be more flexible and actually support storing to server and/or local storage.</li>
<li>Alternatively I might look at <a href="http://docs.sencha.com/touch/2-0/">Sensa Touch 2.0</a> which seems to be more than just a UI framework but actually also include a full MVC framework.</li>
<li>I found some tutorial describing how to integrate PhoneGap, jQuery Mobile, and Backbone, <a href="https://github.com/ccoenraets/backbone-directory/tree/master/jquerymobile">including a bootstrapped app</a> that integrates them all in a way I might be able to re-use.</li>
</ul>

<p>I want to run a new kind of event: <strong>OpenCodeCamp</strong> (working title). OpenCodeCamp should be an event that promotes knowledge sharing and skills swapping amongst developers of any age or level of experience.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&rsquo;ve been attending HackDays since 2007 when I travelled to Alexandra Palace for the first <a href="http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/173371/LONDON/London/Yahoo-BBC-Hackday-2007/Alexandra-Palace/">HackDay organised by Yahoo and the BBC</a>. I was a n00b at that time (some might say I still am, #shakesfist) and I had no idea what to build. At the time I was trying to learn how to use web frameworks and at the HackDay I got my first exposures to APIs, Django, Rails, OpenID and much more. I don&rsquo;t think I made anything that weekend, but damn did I learn a lot!</p>

<p>Since then we&rsquo;ve come a long way; HackDays are no longer just organised by big organisations. There&rsquo;s pretty much one happening every weekend (sometimes more), and they are more often than not focussed around a topic. I attended at least 20 HackDays since, and I even helped organise <a href="http://www.hackcamp.org.uk/">not 1 but 2 HackCamps</a> with <a href="http://geeksoflondon.com">GeeksOfLondon</a>.</p>

<p>But lately I&rsquo;ve been noticing a little trend. I was at <a href="http://www.gamehack.co.uk/">GameHack</a> yesterday and I had come to have a fun weekend to play with some APIs, maybe play with some WebGL libraries, and get an idea of how game development works. I am not a game developer and don&rsquo;t intend to be one, but I always enjoy learning new things.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Here are just some interesting gems and other software that have caught my attention recently:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh">oh-my-zsh</a> makes it easy to use zshell as a replacement for bash on OS X. It is very easy to install and comes with a whole bunch of useful plugins. I&rsquo;ve only really dived half into it but already feel like it&rsquo;s been making my console better. I personally love how it shows the Git branch I&rsquo;m working on at the moment.</li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom_filter">Bloom Filters</a> are a very cool way of doing a quick and space efficient lookup if an item exists in a set. It&rsquo;s used by databases and caches, and Google uses it for their Save Browsing service. There&rsquo;s some cool <a href="https://github.com/igrigorik/bloomfilter-rb">ruby gems</a> that make it easy to use them and I already have an idea where to deploy them next.</li>
<li><a href="http://zachholman.com/talk/how-github-uses-github-to-build-github">How Github uses Github</a> is pretty much how we use Github at EmberAds. The more we do it the more I see the benefits especially:

<ul>
<li>We work asynchronously</li>
<li>We use the hell out of Campfire</li>
<li>Master is always deployable</li>
<li>Pull Requests are our code reviews, requests for comments, and discussion boards.</li>
<li>Other apps have great features like prioritising stuff. But honestly, we have barely touched BaseCamp in weeks.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/EmberAds/cuuid">Fast UUID generation</a> is something we needed at EmberAds seeing as we use UUIDs everywhere and most of the Ruby gems were rather slow.    <a href="http://caius.name">Caius</a> cooked up a Ruby gem that uses a native C library which in our simple benchmarks spit out UUIDs about 6x faster.</li>
<li>On that note, <a href="https://github.com/EmberAds/acts_as_uuid">acts_as_uuid</a> is what we use to store UUIDs on our models in Postgres.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/ondrejbartas/rake-progressbar">Rake progressbar</a> makes it easier for me to understand if I can go and make a brew or not when some of my rake tasks are running.</li>
<li>And finally, static site generators like <a href="http://nanoc.stoneship.org/">Nanoc</a>, <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll">Jekyll</a>, and <a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a> (used on this site) have been really catching my eye lately. Mainly because of the security and scaling implications. I&rsquo;ve been working on a blog post on this, mainly to inspire regular bloggers that you don&rsquo;t need a big server and a massive database to render a Wordpress site that will load slow as hell regardless.</li>
</ul>
