  <div class="entry-content"><h2><a href="/blog/2013/02/07/why-we-dropped-iodocs-and-swagger.html">Why We Dropped Swagger And I/O Docs</a></h2>

<p>As we started investing in <a href="/blog/2013/01/31/farewell-to-regular-web-development-approaches.html">our new strategy</a> at <a href="http://wiredcraft.com">my previous company</a>, we looked around for solutions to document APIs. It may not be the sexiest part of the project, but documentation is the first step to designing a good API. And I mean <strong>first</strong> as in &ldquo;before you even start writing tests&rdquo; (yes, you should be writing tests first too).</p>

<p>We originally went with a simple Wiki page on Github, which served us just fine in the past. But it quickly became clear that it wasn&rsquo;t going to cut it. We started thinking about what good documentations is. We&rsquo;re fans of the single page approach that the <a href="http://backbonejs.com">Backbone.js documentation</a> illustrates well and clearly remembered <a href="http://developer.github.com/">Github</a> and <a href="https://stripe.com/docs">Stripe</a> as easy and well organized resources. Some Googling later, we were contemplating Wordnik&rsquo;s <a href="http://developers.helloreverb.com/swagger/">Swagger</a> and Mashery&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.mashery.com/product/io-docs">I/O Docs</a>. We later settled for I/O Docs as it is built with node.js and was more straightforward to set up (for us at least).</p>

<p>Once again, we hit a wall with this approach:</p>

<ol>
<li><p> <strong>No proper support for JSON body</strong>: we don&rsquo;t do much with parameters and mostly send JSON objects in the body of our requests, <a href="http://blog.apigee.com/detail/restful_api_design_nouns_are_good_verbs_are_bad">using HTTP verbs for the different types of operations</a> we perform on our collections and models in the backend. Swagger and I/O Docs fall short of support for it, letting you simply dump your JSON in a field: not ideal.</p></li>
<li><p> <strong>You&rsquo;re querying the actual API</strong>: to be fair, this is an intentional feature. Now some of you may find it interesting that your documentation allows users to easily run calls against your API. That&rsquo;s what <a href="http://www.flickr.com/services/api/explore/flickr.activity.userComments">Flickr does with their API explorer</a>, and we used to think it was pretty neat. But once we started using it, we saw the risks of exposing so casually API calls that can impact your platform (especially with <a href="http://devo.ps">devo.ps</a> which deals with your actual infrastructure). I guess you could set up a testing API for that very purpose, but that&rsquo;s quite a bit of added complexity (and <a href="http://blogoscoped.com/archive/2005-08-24-n14.html">we&rsquo;re lazy</a>).</p></li>
</ol>


<p>And that&rsquo;s how we ended up putting together <a href="https://github.com/devo-%20ps/carte">Carte</a>, a very lightweight Jekyll-based solution: drop a new post for each API call, following some loose format and specifying a few bits of meta data in the YAML header (type of the method, path…) and you&rsquo;re good to go.</p>

<p><a href="http://devo-ps.github.com/carte"><img src="/images/posts/carte-screenshot.png" alt="Screenshot of Carte" /></a></p>

<p>We&rsquo;re real suckers for Jekyll. We&rsquo;ve actually used it to build quite a few static clients for our APIs. One of the advantages of this approach is that we can bundle our documentation with our codebase by simply pushing it on the
<code>gh-pages</code> branch, and it pops up as a Github page. That&rsquo;s tremendously important for us as it make it very easy for developers to keep the documentation and the code in synch.</p>

<p>Carte is intentionally crude: <a href="https://github.com/devo-ps/carte">have a look at the README and hack at will</a>. Drop us a shout at <a href="https://twitter.com/devo_ps">@devo_ps</a> if you need help or want to suggest a feature.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h2><a href="/blog/2013/02/11/best-practices-it-s-always-or-never.html">Best Practices: It&rsquo;s Always Or Never ( And Preferably Always)</a></h2>

<p><img src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2584/4103140420_b98ee1ac62_z.jpg" alt="Messy cables" /></p>

<p>It&rsquo;s Monday morning. The development team needs a box and you&rsquo;re already contemplating the gazillion other urgent tasks that need to be done on the existing infrastructure. _Just that one time_TM, you&rsquo;re going to forget about your own rules. You&rsquo;re just gonna spawn an instance, set up the few services needed and be done with it. You&rsquo;ll drop some of the usual time suckers: backup strategy, access rules, init scripts, documentation… You can&rsquo;t just do the whole of it AND handle the rest of your day-to-day responsibilities. After all, it&rsquo;s just a development server and you&rsquo;ll probably fold it in a couple weeks, or you&rsquo;ll clean it up once your plate is a tad less full.</p>

<p>A few weeks later, the box is still there and your backlog is far from looking less crowded. The development team just rolled out their production application on the same box. <strong>And things start crashing… badly.</strong></p>

<p>After a couple of not so courteous emails from the dev team mentioning repetitive crashes, you log in the box and the fun starts. You can&rsquo;t figure out what services have been deployed, or how exactly they were installed. You can&rsquo;t restore the database because you don&rsquo;t know where the bloody backups are. You waste time to find out that CouchDB wasn&rsquo;t started at boot. All of this while receiving emails of &ldquo;encouragement&rdquo; from your colleagues.</p>

<p>Just because of that &ldquo;one time&rdquo;. Except that it&rsquo;s never just that one time.</p>

<h3>Best practices are not freaking optional</h3>

<p>I hear you: coming up with these best practices and sticking to it <strong>systematically</strong> is hard. It&rsquo;s high investment. But based on our common experience, it&rsquo;s one you can&rsquo;t afford not making. The &ldquo;quick and dirty that
one time&rdquo; approach will ultimately fail you.</p>

<p>A few things you should never consider skipping:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Document the hell out of everything as you go</strong>. You probably won&rsquo;t have time to get it done once you shipped it, and you probably won&rsquo;t remember what you did or why you did it in a few weeks from now. Your colleagues will probably appreciate too.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Off-site backups for everything</strong>. Don&rsquo;t even think of keeping your backups on the same physical box. Disks fail (a lot) and storage like S3/Glacier is dirt cheap. Find out a way to backup your code and data and stick to it.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Full setup and reliable sources</strong>. Avoid random AWS AMIs or RPM repositories. And when settings things up, go through the whole shebang: init script, dedicated running user, environment variables and such are not optional. Some of us also think that you shouldn&rsquo;t use rc.local for your Web services ever again.</p></li>
</ul>


<h3>Infrastructure As Code And Automation</h3>

<p>Obviously, given what we&rsquo;re working on at <a href="http://devo.ps">devo.ps</a>, we&rsquo;re pretty strong adopters of infrastructure as code and automation. What tools to use is a much larger discussion. Go have a look at the comments on <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5197389">the
announcement of the new version of Chef</a> to get an idea of what&rsquo;s
out there.</p>

<p>Ultimately these are just opinions, but behind them are concepts worth investing in. Capturing the work you do on your infrastructure in repeatable and testable code, and automating as much as you can helps removing yourself
from the equation. Doing so is helping you to reduce the human factor and free yourself of the repetitive boilerplate while you focus on the challenging tasks that only a creative brain can tackle.</p>

<p>Not building upon best practices is simply not an option. By doing so, you fail at investing in the foundation for a more robust infrastructure, and more importantly it is depriving you from scaling yourself.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h2><a href="/blog/2013/03/06/troubleshooting-5minutes-on-a-yet-unknown-box.html">First 5 Minutes Troubleshooting A Server</a></h2>

<p>Back when our team was dealing with operations, optimization and scalability at <a href="http://wiredcraft.com">our previous company</a>, we had our fair share of troubleshooting poorly performing applications and infrastructures of various sizes, often large (think CNN or the World Bank). Tight deadlines, &ldquo;exotic&rdquo; technical stacks and lack of information usually made for memorable experiences.</p>

<p>The cause of the issues was rarely obvious: here are a few things we usually got started with.</p>

<h3>Get some context</h3>

<p>Don&rsquo;t rush on the servers just yet, you need to figure out how much is already known about the server and the specifics of the issues. You don&rsquo;t want to waste your time (trouble) shooting in the dark.</p>

<p>A few &ldquo;must have&rdquo;:</p>

<ul>
<li>What exactly are the symptoms of the issue? Unresponsiveness? Errors?</li>
<li>When did the problem start being noticed?</li>
<li>Is it reproducible?</li>
<li>Any pattern (e.g. happens every hour)?</li>
<li>What were the latest changes on the platform (code, servers, stack)?</li>
<li>Does it affect a specific user segment (logged in, logged out, geographically located…)?</li>
<li>Is there any documentation for the architecture (physical and logical)?</li>
<li><strong>Is there a monitoring platform?</strong> Munin, Zabbix, Nagios, <a href="http://newrelic.com/">New Relic</a>… Anything will do.</li>
<li><strong>Any (centralized) logs?</strong>. Loggly, Airbrake, Graylog…</li>
</ul>


<p>The last two ones are the most convenient sources of information, but don&rsquo;t expect too much: they&rsquo;re also the ones usually painfully absent. Tough luck, make a note to get this corrected and move on.</p>

<h3>Who&rsquo;s there?</h3>

<pre><code>$ w
$ last
</code></pre>

<p>Not critical, but you&rsquo;d rather not be troubleshooting a platform others are playing with. One cook in the kitchen is enough.</p>

<h3>What was previously done?</h3>

<pre><code>$ history
</code></pre>

<p>Always a good thing to look at; combined with the knowledge of who was on the box earlier on. Be responsible by all means, being admin shouldn&rsquo;t allow you to break ones privacy.</p>

<p>A quick mental note for later, you may want to update the environment variable <code>HISTTIMEFORMAT</code> to keep track of the time those commands were ran. Nothing is more frustrating than investigating an outdated list of commands…</p>

<h3>What is running?</h3>

<pre><code>$ pstree -a
$ ps aux
</code></pre>

<p>While <code>ps aux</code> tends to be pretty verbose, <code>pstree -a</code> gives you a nice condensed view of what is running and who called what.</p>

<h3>Listening services</h3>

<pre><code>$ netstat -ntlp
$ netstat -nulp
$ netstat -nxlp
</code></pre>

<p>I tend to prefer running them separately, mainly because I don&rsquo;t like looking at all the services at the same time. <code>netstat -nalp</code> will do to though. Even then, I&rsquo;d ommit the <code>numeric</code> option (IPs are more readable IMHO).</p>

<p>Identify the running services and whether they&rsquo;re expected to be running or not. Look for the various listening ports. You can always match the PID of the process with the output of <code>ps aux</code>; this can be quite useful especially when you end up with 2 or 3 Java or Erlang processes running concurrently.</p>

<p>We usual prefer to have more or less specialized boxes, with a low number of services running on each one of them. If you see 3 dozens of listening ports you probably should make a mental note of investigating this further and see
what can be cleaned up or reorganized.</p>

<h3>CPU and RAM</h3>

<pre><code>$ free -m
$ uptime
$ top
$ htop
</code></pre>

<p>This should answer a few questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Any free RAM? Is it swapping?</li>
<li>Is there still some CPU left? How many CPU cores are available on the server? Is one of them overloaded?</li>
<li>What is causing the most load on the box? What is the load average?</li>
</ul>


<h3>Hardware</h3>

<pre><code>$ lspci
$ dmidecode
$ ethtool
</code></pre>

<p>There are still a lot of bare-metal servers out there, this should help with;</p>

<ul>
<li>Identifying the RAID card (with BBU?), the CPU, the available memory slots. This may give you some hints on potential issues and/or performance improvements.</li>
<li>Is your NIC properly set? Are you running in half-duplex? In 10MBps? Any TX/RX errors?</li>
</ul>


<h3>IO Performances</h3>

<pre><code>$ iostat -kx 2
$ vmstat 2 10
$ mpstat 2 10
$ dstat --top-io --top-bio
</code></pre>

<p>Very useful commands to analyze the overall performances of your backend;</p>

<ul>
<li>Checking the disk usage: has the box a filesystem/disk with 100% disk usage?</li>
<li>Is the swap currently in use (si/so)?</li>
<li>What is using the CPU: system? User? Stolen (VM)?</li>
<li><code>dstat</code> is my all-time favorite. What is using the IO? Is MySQL sucking up the resources? Is it your PHP processes?</li>
</ul>


<h3>Mount points and filesystems</h3>

<pre><code>$ mount
$ cat /etc/fstab
$ vgs
$ pvs
$ lvs
$ df -h
$ lsof +D / /* beware not to kill your box */
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>How many filesystems are mounted?</li>
<li>Is there a dedicated filesystem for some of the services? (MySQL by any chance..?)</li>
<li>What are the filesystem mount options: noatime? default? Have some filesystem been re-mounted as read-only?</li>
<li>Do you have any disk space left?</li>
<li>Is there any big (deleted) files that haven&rsquo;t been flushed yet?</li>
<li>Do you have room to extend a partition if disk space is an issue?</li>
</ul>


<h3>Kernel, interrupts and network usage</h3>

<pre><code>$ sysctl -a | grep ...
$ cat /proc/interrupts
$ cat /proc/net/ip_conntrack /* may take some time on busy servers */
$ netstat
$ ss -s
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>Are your IRQ properly balanced across the CPU? Or is one of the core overloaded because of network interrupts, raid card, …?</li>
<li>How much is swappinness set to? 60 is good enough for workstations, but when it come to servers this is generally a bad idea: you do not want your server to swap… ever. Otherwise your swapping process will be locked while data is read/written to the disk.</li>
<li>Is <code>conntrack_max</code> set to a high enough number to handle your traffic?</li>
<li>How long do you maintain TCP connections in the various states (<code>TIME_WAIT</code>, …)?</li>
<li><code>netstat</code> can be a bit slow to display all the existing connections, you may want to use <code>ss</code> instead to get a summary.</li>
</ul>


<p>Have a look at <a href="http://www.lognormal.com/blog/2012/09/27/linux-tcpip-tuning/">Linux TCP tuning</a> for some more pointer as to how to tune your network stack.</p>

<h3>System logs and kernel messages</h3>

<pre><code>$ dmesg
$ less /var/log/messages
$ less /var/log/secure
$ less /var/log/auth
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>Look for any error or warning messages; is it spitting issues about the number of connections in your conntrack being too high?</li>
<li>Do you see any hardware error, or filesystem error?</li>
<li>Can you correlate the time from those events with the information provided beforehand?</li>
</ul>


<h3>Cronjobs</h3>

<pre><code>$ ls /etc/cron* + cat
$ for user in $(cat /etc/passwd | cut -f1 -d:); do crontab -l -u $user; done
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>Is there any cron job that is running too often?</li>
<li>Is there some user&rsquo;s cron that is &ldquo;hidden&rdquo; to the common eyes?</li>
<li>Was there a backup of some sort running at the time of the issue?</li>
</ul>


<h3>Application logs</h3>

<p>There is a lot to analyze here, but it&rsquo;s unlikely you&rsquo;ll have time to be exhaustive at first. Focus on the obvious ones, for example in the case of a LAMP stack:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Apache &amp; Nginx</strong>; chase down access and error logs, look for <code>5xx</code> errors, look for possible <code>limit_zone</code> errors.</li>
<li><strong>MySQL</strong>; look for errors in the <code>mysql.log</code>, trace of corrupted tables, innodb repair process in progress. Looks for slow logs and define if there is disk/index/query issues.</li>
<li><strong>PHP-FPM</strong>; if you have php-slow logs on, dig in and try to find errors (php, mysql, memcache, …). If not, set it on.</li>
<li><strong>Varnish</strong>; in <code>varnishlog</code> and <code>varnishstat</code>, check your hit/miss ratio. Are you missing some rules in your config that let end-users hit your backend instead?</li>
<li><strong>HA-Proxy</strong>; what is your backend status? Are your health-checks successful? Do you hit your max queue size on the frontend or your backends?</li>
</ul>


<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>After these first 5 minutes (give or take 10 minutes) you should have a better
understanding of:</p>

<ul>
<li>What is running.</li>
<li>Whether the issue seems to be related to IO/hardware/networking or configuration (bad code, kernel tuning, …).</li>
<li>Whether there&rsquo;s a pattern you recognize: for example a bad use of the DB indexes, or too many apache workers.</li>
</ul>


<p>You may even have found the actual root cause. If not, you should be in a good place to start digging further, with the knowledge that you&rsquo;ve covered the obvious.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h2><a href="/blog/2013/09/11/zookeeper-vs-doozer-vs-etcd.html">ZooKeeper vs. Doozer vs. Etcd</a></h2>

<p>While <a href="http://devo.ps">devo.ps</a> is fast approaching a public release, the team has been dealing with an increasingly complex infrastructure. We more recently faced an interesting issue; how do you share configuration across a cluster of servers? More importantly, how do you do so in a resilient, secure, easily deployable and speedy fashion?</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s what got us to evaluate some of the options available out there;
ZooKeeper, Doozer and etcd. These tools all solve similar sets of problems but their approach differ quite significantly. Since we spent some time evaluating them, we thought we&rsquo;d share our findings.</p>

<h3>ZooKeeper, the old dog</h3>

<p><a href="http://zookeeper.apache.org/">ZooKeeper</a> is the most well known (and oldest) project we&rsquo;ve looked into. It&rsquo;s used by a few big players (Rackspace, Yahoo, eBay, <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6367979">Youtube</a>) and is pretty mature.</p>

<p>It was created by Yahoo to deal with distributed systems applications. I strongly recommend you <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/blogs/hadoop/apache-zookeeper-making-417.html">read the &ldquo;making of&rdquo;</a> if you&rsquo;re interested in understanding where Yahoo came from when they wrote it.</p>

<p>It stores variables in a structure similar to a file system, an approach that both Doozer and etcd still follow. With ZooKeeper, you maintain a cluster of servers communicating with each other that share the state of the distributed configuration data. Each cluster elects one &ldquo;leader&rdquo; and clients can connect to any of the servers within the cluster to retrieve the data. Zookeeper uses its own algorithm to handle distributed storage.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Pros</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Mature technology</strong>; it is used by some big players (eBay, Yahoo et al).</li>
<li><strong>Feature-rich</strong>; lots of client bindings, tools, API…</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Cons</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Complex</strong>; ZooKeeper is not for the faint of heart. It is pretty heavy and will require you to maintain a fairly large stack.</li>
<li><strong>It&#8217;s… Java</strong>; not that we especially hate Java, but it is on the heavy side and introduce a lot of dependencies. We wanted to keep our machines as lean as possible and usually shy away from dependency heavy technologies.</li>
<li><strong>Apache…</strong>; we have mixed feelings about the Apache Foundation. <a href="http://www.infoworld.com/d/open-source-software/has-apache-lost-its-way-225267">&ldquo;Has Apache Lost Its Way?&rdquo;</a> summarizes it pretty well.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<h3>Doozer, kinda dead</h3>

<p><a href="https://github.com/ha/doozerd">Doozer</a> was developed by Heroku a few years
ago. It&rsquo;s written in Go (yay!), which means it compiles into a single binary
that runs without dependencies. On a side-note, if you&rsquo;re writing code to
manage infrastructure, you should spend some time <a href="http://golang.org/">learning
Go</a>.</p>

<p>Doozer got some initial excitement from the developer community but seems to
have stalled more recently, with many forks being sporadically maintained and
no active core development.</p>

<p>It is composed of <a href="https://github.com/ha/doozerd">a daemon</a> and <a href="https://github.com/ha/doozer">a
client</a>. Once you have at least one Doozer
server up, you can add any number of servers and have clients get and set data
by talking to any of the servers within that cluster.</p>

<p>It was one of the first practical implementations (as far as I know) of the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paxos_(computer_science">Paxos algorithm</a>). This
means operations can be slow when compared to dealing with a straight database
since cluster-wide consensus needs to be reached before committing any
operation.</p>

<p>Doozer was a step in the right direction. It is simple to use and setup.
However, after using it for a while we started noticing that a lot of its
parts felt unfinished. Moreover, it wasn&rsquo;t answering some of our needs very
well (encryption and ACL).</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Pros</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Easy to deploy, setup and use</strong> (Go, yay!)</li>
<li><strong>It works</strong>; lots of people have actually used it in production.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Cons</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Pretty much dead</strong>: the core project hasn&rsquo;t been active in a while (1 commit since May) and is pretty fragmented (150 forks…).</li>
<li><strong>Security</strong>; no encryption and a fairly simple secure-word based authentication.</li>
<li><strong>No ACL</strong>; and we badly needed this.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<h3>etcd</h3>

<p>After experiencing the shortcomings of Doozer, we stumbled upon a new
distributed configuration storage called
<a href="https://github.com/coreos/etcd">etcd</a>. It was first released by the
<a href="http://coreos.com">CoreOS</a> team a month ago.</p>

<p>Etcd and Doozer look pretty similar, at least on the surface. The most obvious
technical difference is that ectd uses the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raft_%28computer_science%29">Raft
algorithm</a> instead
of Paxos. Raft is designed to be <a href="https://ramcloud.stanford.edu/wiki/%0Adownload/attachments/11370504/raft.pdf">simpler</a> and
<a href="http://kellabyte.com/2013/05/09/an-alternative-to-paxos-the-raft-%0Aconsensus-algorithm/">easier</a> to implement than Paxos.</p>

<p>Etcd&rsquo;s architecture is similar to Doozer&rsquo;s. It does, however, store data
persistently (writes log and snapshots), which was of value to us for some
edge cases. It also has a better take on security, with CA&rsquo;s, certs and
private keys. While setting it up is not straightforward, it adds conveniency
and safety of mind.</p>

<p>Beyond the fact that it answered some of our more advanced needs, we were
seduced (and impressed) by the development pace of the project.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Pros</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Easy to deploy, setup and use</strong> (yay Go and yay HTTP interfaces!).</li>
<li><strong>Data persistence</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Secure</strong>: encryption and authentication by private keys.</li>
<li><strong>Good documentation</strong> (if a little bit obscure at times).</li>
<li>Planned ACL implementation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Cons</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>(Very) <strong>young project</strong>; interfaces are still moving pretty quickly.</li>
<li>Still not a perfect match, especially in the way that data is spread.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<h3>The DIY approach (yeah, right..?)</h3>

<p>It is only fair that technical teams may rely on their understanding of their
infrastructure and coding skills to get <em>something that just works™</em> in place.
We haven&rsquo;t seriously considered this approach as we felt that getting security
and distributed state sharing right was going to be a bigger endeavor than we
could afford (the backlog is full enough for now).</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>In the end, we decided to give etcd a try. So far it seems to work well for
our needs and the very active development pace seems to validate our choice.
It has proven resilient and will likely hold well until we have the resources
to either customize its data propagation approach, or build our own solution
that will answer some needs it is not likely to answer (we&rsquo;ve already looked
into doing so with ZeroMQ and Go).</p>

<p><img class="left" src="/assets/images/gh-pages.png" title="'gh-pages'" >Deploy <a href="https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/">reveal.js slideshow</a> on github-pages was ridiculously easy.</p>

<p>Cloned reveal.js master branch to my local machine:</p>

<pre><code>git clone git@github.com:hakimel/reveal.js.git
</code></pre>

<p>Remove the history &ndash; of you want to preserve history ( <strong>git remote rm origin</strong> and add your new remote)</p>

<pre><code>rm -Rf .git 
</code></pre>

<p>Add your new remote (you need to create a repository first)</p>

<pre><code>git remote add origin git@github.com:tikalk-cookbooks/chef_workshop_presentation.git
</code></pre>

<p>You know the rest &hellip;</p>

<pre><code>git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git push origin master
</code></pre>

<p>In order to push master to github pages you should create a branch names <em><strong>gh-pages</strong></em> and it&nbsp;<strong>must</strong> be named that, the commit &amp; push to this branch and about 2 minuets later you can browse to your presentation on gh-pages.</p>

<p><em><strong>Create a branch</strong></em>:</p>

<pre><code>git branch hg-pages
git push origin gh-pages&lt;/pre&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>updating this &quot;site&quot; can be done by editing the stuff you want on the &quot;master&quot; branch, then merge     those changes in the gh-pages branch and finally push those changes to the remote gh-pages which will automatically deploy youe reveal.js presentaion.</p>

<p>the merge sould look somthing like:</p>

<pre><code>hagzag-Lap-hagzag:chef_workshop_presentaion(master) $ git checkout gh-pages&amp;nbsp;

hagzag-Lap-hagzag:chef_workshop_presentaion(gh-pages) $ git merge master&amp;nbsp;

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img class="left" src="/assets/images/Opscode_chef_logo.png" title="'Chef Logo'" > For the past ~6 monthes or so I have been working solely with <a href="http://docs.opscode.com/chef_solo.html">chef-solo</a>.
There are quite a few helpers for solo out there such as:</p>

<ol>
<li>soloist &ndash; <a href="https://github.com/mkocher/soloist">https://github.com/mkocher/soloist</a></li>
<li>knife-solo &ndash; <a href="https://github.com/matschaffer/knife-solo">https://github.com/matschaffer/knife-solo</a>
&amp; a few more.</li>
</ol>


<p>What kept annoying me for some time is I couldn&rsquo;t manage databas with knife whilst working in solo mode &hellip; ARRRRRRGH!!!</p>

<p>It looked somthing like:</p>

<pre><code>[oper@sandbox chef_repo]$ knife data bag create admins
ERROR: The object you are looking for could not be found
Response: &lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//IETF//DTD HTML 2.0//EN"&gt;
&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;
&lt;title&gt;404 Not Found&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Not Found&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The requested URL /data was not found on this server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;address&gt;Apache/2.2.15 (CentOS) Server at : Port 80&lt;/address&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Then came <a href="https://github.com/thbishop/knife-solo_data_bag">knife-solo_data_bag</a> I am quite embaressed to say ;) I haven&rsquo;t found this sooner.
Now with a totally bogus knife.rb file I can generate / edit / manager databags with knife-solo &amp; knife-solo_data_bag.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img class="left" src="/assets/images/amazon-s3.png" title="'S3 logo'" >A <code>cheap</code> solution on Amazon s3 for uploading files to s3 via SSH</p>

<p>I needed to upload files from my Corporate environment in a <code>push mode</code> meaning I do not open any &ldquo;special&rdquo; ports in my environemnt in order to enable users to put files on S3.
I am curentelly testing to see how robust this solution really is but basically what I found myself doing is install s3fs (<a href="https://code.google.com/p/s3fs/">link to project page</a>) like so:</p>

<pre><code>wget http://s3fs.googlecode.com/files/s3fs-1.73.tar.gz
tar xvzf s3fs-1.73.tar.gz
cd s3fs-1.73
./configure --prefix=/usr
make &amp;&amp; make install
</code></pre>

<p>I was installing this for Suse but for Amazon linux/redhat etc you might find a package see: <a href="http://rpmfind.net/linux/rpm2html/search.php?query=fuse-s3fs">here</a>.</p>

<p>Once the package is installed you can use <code>s3fs</code></p>

<pre><code>s3fs BUCKET:[PATH] MOUNTPOINT [OPTION]...

s3fs dev_tools /mnt/dev_tools/ 
</code></pre>

<p>Worth noting you do not need to specify the s3 url, you only specify the bucket name !</p>

<p>The same thing / very similir in <code>/etc/fstab</code> will look like so:</p>

<pre><code>s3fs#dev_tools /mnt/dev_tools fuse allow_other,user=youruser 0 0
</code></pre>

<p>The mount opts are <strong>extreemly important</strong> &ndash; without the <code>allow_other</code> flag the user cannot write to the directory.</p>

<p>This is really awesome &ndash; we now jsut need to make sure the connectivity is reliable / fast enough and this will become very usefull.</p>

<p>As always hope you find this useful.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h2><a href="/blog/2013/09/25/vagrant-docker-and-ansible-wtf.html">Vagrant, Docker and Ansible. WTF?</a></h2>

<p>Given that we&rsquo;re building a SaaS that helps our client managing their infrastructure, our team is pretty familiar with leveraging VMs and configuration management tools. We&rsquo;ve actually been heavy users of Vagrant and <a href="http://devo.ps/blog/2013/07/03/ansible-simply-kicks-ass.html">Ansible</a> for
the past year, and it&rsquo;s helped us tremendously normalize our development process.</p>

<p>As our platform grew in complexity, some additional needs emerged:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Containerization</strong>; we needed to be able to safely execute custom, and potentially harmful, code.</li>
<li><strong>Weight</strong>; as we added more sub-systems to devo.ps, having full blown VMs proved to be hard to juggle with when testing and developing.</li>
</ul>


<p>And that&rsquo;s why we ended up adding Docker to our development workflow. We were already familiar with it (as it powers some parts of the devo.ps infrastructure) and knew there would be obvious wins. In practice, we are shipping Docker containers in a main Vagrant image and drive some of the customization and upgrade with Ansible.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ll probably write something about this approach in the coming weeks, but given the amount of confusion there is around what these technologies are, and how they&rsquo;re used, we thought we&rsquo;d give you a quick tour on how to use them together.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s get started.</p>

<h2>Vagrant</h2>

<p>You&rsquo;ve probably heard about <a href="http://www.vagrantup.com/">Vagrant</a>; a healthy number of people have been writing about it in the past 6 months. For those of you who haven&rsquo;t, think of it as a VM without the GUI. At its core, Vagrant is a simple wrapper around Virtualbox/VMware.</p>

<p>A few interesting features:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Boatloads of existing images</strong>, just check <a href="http://www.vagrantbox.es/">Vagrantbox.es</a> for example.</li>
<li><strong>Snapshot and package your current machine</strong> to a Vagrant box file (and, consequently, share it back).</li>
<li><strong>Ability to fine tune settings of the VM</strong>, including things like RAM, CPU, APIC…</li>
<li><strong>Vagrantfiles</strong>. This allows you to setup your box on init: installing packages, modifying configuration, moving code around…</li>
<li><strong>Integration with CM tools</strong> like Puppet, Chef and Ansible.</li>
</ul>


<p>Let&rsquo;s get it running on your machine:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>1. First, [download Vagrant](http://downloads.vagrantup.com/) 
</span><span class='line'>     and [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads).
</span><span class='line'>  2. Second, let's download an image, spin it up and SSH in:
</span><span class='line'>   $ vagrant init precise64 http://files.vagrantup.com/precise64.box
</span><span class='line'>   $ vagrant up
</span><span class='line'>   $ vagrant ssh
</span><span class='line'>  3. There's no 3.
</span><span class='line'>  4. There's a 4 if you want to access your (soon to be) deployed app; 
</span><span class='line'>  5. you will need to dig around the Vagrant documentation to 
</span><span class='line'>     [perform port forwarding](http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/networking/forwarded_ports.html), 
</span><span class='line'>     [proper networking](http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/networking/private_network.html) 
</span><span class='line'>     and update manually your `Vagrantfile`.</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h2>Docker</h2>

<p><a href="http://docker.io">Docker</a> is a Linux container, written in <a href="http://golang.org">Go</a> (yay!) and based on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LXC">lxc</a> (self-described as &ldquo;chroot on steroids&rdquo;) and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aufs">AUFS</a>. Instead of providing a full VM, like you get with Vagrant, Docker provides you lightweight containers, that share the same kernel and allow to safely execute independent
processes.</p>

<p>Docker is attractive for many reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Lightweight</strong>; images are much lighter than full VMs, and spinning off a new instance is lightning fast (in the range of seconds instead of minutes).</li>
<li><strong>Version control of the images</strong>, which makes it much more convenient to handle builds.</li>
<li><strong>Lots of images</strong> (again), just have a look at <a href="https://index.docker.io">the docker public index of images</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>You now have a Docker container, inside a Vagrant box (<em>Inception</em> style),
ready to run a Node.js app.</p>

<h2>Ansible</h2>

<p><a href="http://ansible.cc">Ansible</a> is an orchestration and configuration management tool written in Python. If you want to learn more about Ansible (and you should…), <a href="/blog/2013/07/03/ansible-simply-kicks-ass.html">we wrote about it a few weeks ago</a>.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s get to work. We&rsquo;re now gonna deploy an app in our container:</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s it. You&rsquo;ve just deployed your app on Docker (in Vagrant).</p>

<h2>Let&rsquo;s wrap it up</h2>

<p>So we just saw (roughly) how these tools can be used, and how they can be
complementary:</p>

<ol>
<li> Vagrant will provide you with a full VM, including the OS. It&rsquo;s great at providing you a Linux environment for example when you&rsquo;re on MacOS.</li>
<li> Docker is a lightweight VM of some sort. It will allow you to build contained architectures faster and cheaper than with Vagrant.</li>
<li> Ansible is what you&rsquo;ll use to orchestrate and fine-tune things. That&rsquo;s what you want to structure your deployment and orchestration strategy.</li>
</ol>


<p>It takes a bit of reading to get more familiar with these tools, and we&rsquo;ll likely follow up on this post in the next few weeks. However, especially as a small team, this kind of technology allows you to automate and commoditize huge parts of your development and ops workflows. We strongly encourage you to make that investment. It has helped us tremendously increase the pace and
quality of our throughput.</p>

If you don&rsquo;t know what librarian is &ndash; get to know it :) (it makes life much easier)[<a href="http://rubydoc.info/gems/librarian-chef">http://rubydoc.info/gems/librarian-chef</a>] than way back when &hellip;</p>

<p>The most annoying thing happend to me earlier this evening, I was working on a cookbook [A chef cookbook &hellip;, I don&rsquo;t actually do the cooking at home :)], and running librarian install yielded the following error:</p>

<pre><code>"Cheffile and Cheffile.lock are out of sync!"
</code></pre>

<p>So like a good boy I remoced the Cheffile.lock and ran it again resulting with the same damn error message &hellip; arrrrrr !</p>

<p>So after examening my Cheffile over and over I noticed I have listed a dependency from two different location somthing like the followin [ clieng url&rsquo;s omitted from snippet ]:</p>

<p>If you look a line numbers 11 &amp; 14 you will see I am specifying the smae cookbook from tow different sources &hellip;, this is a good thing, your dependecny mechanisem / tool isn&rsquo;t making decitions for you [ unlike Maven for exmaple &hellip; ].</p>

Well just got a mac from my new project <a href="http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10151661183017850&amp;l=69918509f3">FB Status</a>&hellip; &ndash; couldn&rsquo;t resist it :)</p>

<p>One of the tasks was to setup an environment, and learn what a mac is :), a few days later I&rsquo;m in love but still I need a way to destroy an recover
my environment.
I have a few plans like bash_it / oh_my_zsh &amp; others, but until then I put togter a few scripts [ more to come ], the first of them is this one installing Xcode CLI Tools on Mac OSX Mountain Lion.</p>

<p>Install or (un-install) with the following simple command:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<p>I took the liberty (not sure it&rsquo;s mine to take &hellip; but still), locating Xcode CLI tools for both mountain lion (10.8) and Lion (10.7) on <a href="http://www.dropbox.com">DropBox</a>, ecause Apple (like Oracle and other Giants) won&rsquo;t let you download without a userid / pass which is quite irretating &hellip;</p>

<p>As Always hope you guy&rsquo;s enjoy this.
